    "text": "What is Markup?\nA markup language is a system for annotating a document that provides structure and meaning to the content, allowing it to be processed and displayed in a consistent manner across different platforms and devices.\nExtremely brief history\n\nGML (Generalized Markup Language): Developed in the 1960s by IBM, GML was one of the first markup languages. It was designed to help with the publishing process by defining the structure and content of documents.\nSGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language): Evolved from GML in the 1980s, SGML became an ISO standard and was used as the basis for several other markup languages, including HTML.\nHTML (HyperText Markup Language): Developed in the early 1990s by Tim Berners-Lee, HTML became the standard markup language for creating web pages. It’s a subset of SGML.\nXML (eXtensible Markup Language): Introduced in the late 1990s, XML was designed to store and transport data. Unlike HTML, which is about displaying information, XML is about carrying information."

    "text": "Technically speaking\n\nTeX (aka \\(\\LaTeX\\)) is not a markup language, but a software system for document preparation. This is because plain text is used as opposed to other markup languages. However, markup tagging conventions are used to define and stylize document stucture, graphical elements, citations and text.\nMarkdown is an extremely simplified alternative to document preparation software systems. markdown is a lightweigt markup language that can be edited using any text editor, while being quick and easy to compile. It is nowadays widely considered as the language of the internet as it bridges most great attributes of other markup languages.\nQuarto is even more comprehensive as it is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system. quarto is aimed at delivering reproducible, consistent Pandoc markdown documents that unify the best of all other markup languages."

When you save a Word document, you’re saving XML data.\nWeb Services: Many web services and APIs return data in XML format, which is then processed and displayed by the application.\nRSS Feeds: Used by news websites and blogs to syndicate content, RSS feeds are XML documents that can be read by various applications."

Both distributions come with an excellent (but basic) editor (Texworks in Texlive and TexShop in MacTex), but if you want to go the fancy way: there are very good alternatives. See this page for a comprehensive overview of all TeX editors and code editors with TeX capabilities.\nAlternatively, you can use the online TeX editor Overleaf.

Students will get to know the professional field of statistical markup and its innovations and challenges. It consists of meetings in which students will learn about markup languages (\\(\\LaTeX\\) and Markdown), learn efficient programming with R Markdown, experience developing Shiny web apps, get to know version control with Git and will create and maintain their own data archive repository and personal (business card) page through GitHub. Combining these lectures, the students get acquainted with different viewpoints on marking up statistical manuscripts, areas of innovation, and challenges that people face when working with, analyzing and reporting (simulated) data. Knowledge obtained from this course will help students face multidimensional problems during their professional career."

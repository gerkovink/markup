In this practical you'll learn ...

Dear all, 

To document our activity and our changes in detail, we'll use [`Git`](https://git-scm.com). You can view `Git` as the ability to go back in time. Back to the very beginning of your project. A bonus: `Git` integrates nicely with `RStudio`. In this exercise we will learn 

1. How to integrate `Git` within our projects. 
2. How to publish our projects as `GitHub` repositories
3. How to go about development with `Git` and `GitHub`

Use the appropriate channels to ask questions and hand-in your work.

All the best, 

Gerko

# `Git`
`Git` is a free and open source version control system for text files. It can handle extensive change logging for you, no matter the size of the project. `Git` is fast and efficient, but its effectiveness depends also on the frequency you instruct it to log your project's changes. 

You can see `Git` as a blank canvas that starts at a certain point in time. Every time you (or others) instruct `Git` to log any changes that have been made, `Git` adds the changes that are made to this canvas. We call the changes to the canvas [`commits`](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#commit). With every `commit` an extensive log is created that includes at least the following information:

- the changes made
- who made the changes
- metadata
- a small piece of text that describe the changes made

The difference between two commits - or the changes between them - are called [`diffs`](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#diff). 

If you'd like to know much more about `Git`, [this online book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) is a very good resource. If you'd like to practice with the command line interface [use this webpage](https://learngitbranching.js.org) for a quick course. [This book](https://happygitwithr.com) covers pretty much everything you need to marry `git` and `R`. 

---

# `GitHub`
`GitHub` is the social and user interface to `Git` that allows you to work in [repositories](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#repository). These repositories can be seen as project folders in which you publish your work, but you can also use them as test sites for development, testing, etcetera. There is a distinction between [private repositories](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#private-repository) (only for you and those you grant access) and public repositories (visible for everyone). 

Your public repositories can be viewed and [forked](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#fork) by everyone. `Forking` is when other people create a copy of your repository on their own account. This allows them to work on a repository without affecting the `master`. You can also do this yourself, but then the process is called [`branching`](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#branch) instead of forking. If you create a copy of a repository that is offline, the process is called [`cloning`](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#clone). 

`GitHub`'s ability to branch, fork and clone is very useful as it allows other people and yourself to experiment on (the code in) a repository before any definitive changes are [`merged`](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#merge) with the `master`. If you're working in a forked repository, you can submit a [`pull request`](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#pull-request) to the repository collaborators to accept (or reject) any suggested changes. 

For now, this may be confusing, but I hope you recognize the benefits `GitHub` can have on the process of development and bug-fixing. For example, the most up-to-date version of the `mice` package in `R` can be directly installed from the `mice` repository with the following code:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github(repo = "amices/mice")
```

You can see that this process requires package `devtools` that expands the `R` functionality with essential development tools. Loading packages in `R` directly from their respective `GitHub` repositories, allows you to obtain the latest - often improved and less buggy - iteration of that software even before it is published on [`CRAN`](https://cran.r-project.org). 


---

# Installing `Git`

## Installing on Mac
I suggest you install `Git` by downloading and installing [`GitHub Desktop`](https://desktop.github.com). `GitHub`'s desktop application is a nice GUI and, naturally, integrates well into the repository workflow on `GitHub`. 

When installed, you can go to `GitHub Desktop > Install Command Line Tool`

After a reboot, all should be set. 

## Installing on Windows
Download and install [`Git for Windows`](https://git-for-windows.github.io), Then download and install [`GitHub Desktop`](https://desktop.github.com). `GitHub`'s desktop application is a nice GUI and, naturally, integrates well into the repository workflow on `GitHub`. 

After a reboot, all should be set. 

---

# Command line interface vs. GUI
Ultimately, you'll want to learn how to use `Git` through the command line interface (CLI). It offers better and more comprehensive functionality. Again, [take this 15-minute course](https://learngitbranching.js.org) to get a gentle introduction. But do not be afraid that you miss out on the CLI if you don't study this link: In week 4 we'll explore in detail how to handle `Git` when things go haywire. You'll be a CLI-wizard by then. 

---

# .gitignore
GitHub sees every file in your repository as one of the following three

- **tracked files** that have been (previously) staged and committed
- **untracked files** that have not been staged or committed
- **ignored files** that have been explicitly ignored

It may be wise to instruct `Git` to ignore changes in some files. For example, compiled files (think about `.com`, `.exe`, `.o`, `.so`, etc), archives (e.g. `.zip`, `.tar`, `.rar`), logs (`.log`) and files generated in runtime (`.temp`) do not have to be tracked by `Git`. The same holds for hidden system files (e.g. `.DS_Store` or `Thumbs.db`). Adding such filetypes to a file named `.gitignore` and placing that file in the root of your repository will take care of focusing `Git`'s energy on useful files only. For common `.gitignore` examples, see [this repository](https://github.com/github/gitignore). There are many examples inside, such as [this `.gitignore` example for `R`](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/R.gitignore)

# Linking `GitHub` and `RStudio`
Securely linking your local machine to the remote repository is vital when collaborating with other people. In short; you would not want a potential hacker to have contributor access to any of your projects. I have prepared [this walkthrough video](Link Git and RStudio.mp4) that details the process of linking `GitHub` to your machine and `RStudio`. Below I explain the rationale of using both an SSH key and a personal access token. 

If you still experience problems after following my walkthrough, check [this chapter](https://happygitwithr.com/troubleshooting.html)

To learn more about maintaining a package as `GitHub` repository within `RStudio`, have a look at [this guide](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/git.html) by [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz).

---

## SSH keys
With an SSH key you can identify yourself to an online server (in this case the `GitHub` server) without having to log in every time. It is like your machine having access to an online server through a unique biometric security measure, but instead of biometric data a bits-and-bytes hash code is communicated every time. You will need an SSH key to link `RStudio` to your `GitHub` repository. 

--- 

## Personal access tokens
If you use `GitHub`'s 2FA functionality - you should! - your username and password are not sufficient to `push` `commits` to `GitHub` through `RStudio`. To solve this follow these steps on [github.com](https://github.com) like I detail in [this walkthrough video](Link Git and RStudio.mp4):

1. Log in to your account
2. Click on your profile photo (upper right corner) and select `Settings`
3. Go to `Developer settings`
4. Select `Personal access tokens` in the left sidebar
5. Click `Generate new token`
6. Give the token a name
7. Select at least the `repo` scope; you'll need these permissions to access repositories
8. Click Generate token

Copy the token. The token will not be displayed again, so make a note of it, or save it somewhere.

In `RStudio`, paste the generated token in the password field when `RStudio` asks for your credentials. The token will now serve as the unique authenticated link instead of your password.

# `Git` exercise

1. Fork the course repository. See also [this walkthrough video](Creating a branch.mp4) I've made for you that details the next couple of steps. 
2. Clone the fork to your machine
3. Create a new branch
4. Add two pieces of personal information to a `Yourname/Assignment 1` folder. 
5. Commit the changes
6. Push to your `GitHub` fork
7. Send a pull request to incorporate your changes into the `upstream/master` branch (i.e. `gerkovink/markup2020`). I have made [another walkthrough video](Create PR.mp4) for you that details this step.

# Advanced `git`

Dear all, 

This week we will learn how to use $git$ properly when we mess up. But let's not learn that on this year's repo ;-). Fork the last year's repository [here](https://github.com/gerkovink/markup2020), deselect! `Copy the master branch only` in order to copy all branches and checkout the `Exercise_wk4` branch.

Let's start. 

Gerko

---

# Disclaimer
I'll take you by the hand through the exercise. So if you follow this manual step by step, you'll be done at the end and you will have a good notion of troubleshooting with `git` [or a reference thereof]. 

This exercise is a summary of important commands. A full and comprehensive overview can be found in [the `pro git` book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2).

O, and I forgot to tell you: you'll need the terminal for this exercise. You may use the one in `RStudio`, or the dedicated terminal on UNIX systems or the command prompt or [Windows Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) on Windows. 

---

# Prepare
Before we continue it is good to all start from the point of departure. 

1. Use the terminal to navigate to the `git` repository (the location of the git repo on your HDD)
2. Type `git pull` to make sure that you obtain the latest state from the remote on `GitHub`

```console
% git pull
Already up to date.
```
Don't type the `%`; that is just the command prompt indicator on my machine. Yours may be different, such as `>` or `$`. We see that `git` reminds me that I already have the latest state. I am up to date. 

3. Change the branch to the `Exercise_wk4` branch. 

```console
% git checkout Exercise_wk4
Switched to branch 'Exercise_wk4'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/Exercise_wk4'.
```

I've now been switched to the `Exercise_wk4` branch. It is up to date with `origin/Exercise_wk4`, meaning that GitHub and my local copy are in sync. `origin` is a shorthand name for the remote repository that a project was originally cloned from. It is useful that `origin` is referenced instead of the original repo's URL --> This makes referencing much more convenient.


---

# Inspect the current state

Make sure you are in the `Exercise_wk4` branch. Then Use `git log --graph` to inspect the current Git branch and its commits.

```{console}
% git log --graph

This graph view is much more condensed. The nice thing about this view is the direct depiction of each action's abbreviated SHA-1 key. 

We can use the SHA-1 keys to instruct `git`. For example, to obtain the history on commit `c902093`, we only need to refer the SHA-1 hash. 
```{console}
% git log c902093

Please note that we only reference the short hash. There is no need to reference the longer hash as long as the sequence of the shorter reference is unique. 

From this `--pretty=oneline` view it is now easy to spot the origin of our course repository - the initial commit that initiated the `git` goodness. You can also see that I updated the `.gitignore`, a hidden file that specifies which files and directories to be ignored by `git`. And I did some cosmetic changes and file deletions. This is very insightfull because of the detailed, but consice commit messages.

# Checkout an old state

Go back in time to `21a3b5ac1535703f4ce0d6feb2ccf3703f95eee3 Merge pull request #2 from gerkovink/gerkodev`. 

To do so, we only need to refer the start of the SHA-1 key. 

```{console}
% git checkout 21a3b5a
Note: switching to '21a3b5a'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

  git switch -c <new-branch-name>

Or undo this operation with:

  git switch -

Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false

HEAD is now at 21a3b5a Merge pull request #2 from gerkovink/gerkodev
```

We are now at the old state. So we went back in time. The current state where we are is independent from all later commits, but is built exactly on all preceding commits as per the tree. 

There are a couple of terms that are *new*:

- HEAD: *The HEAD in `git` is the pointer to the current branch reference. It is the last commit you have made or checked out [in our case].* **REMEMBER that the head will always serve as the parent to the next commit**
- detached HEAD: *The same as the head, but now the pointer references a specific commit and not a branch. *

---

## The problem with a detached HEAD

[This webpage](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/faq/detached-head-when-checkout-commit/) illustrates the dangers of committing changes under a detached head quite nicely:


> The HEAD pointer in `git` determines your current working revision (and thereby the files that are placed in your project's working directory). Normally, when checking out a proper branch name, Git automatically moves the HEAD pointer along when you create a new commit. You are automatically on the newest commit of the chosen branch.
<br><br> When you instead choose to check out a commit hash, `git` won't do this for you. The consequence is that when you make changes and commit them, these changes do NOT belong to any branch.
This means they can easily get lost once you check out a different revision or branch: not being recorded in the context of a branch, you lack the possibility to access that state easily (unless you have a brilliant memory and can remember the commit hash of that new commit...).

The useful thing about going to an old commit is that you can take this state as a point of departure. Just beware of the pitfalls of working under a detached HEAD. 

---

## leave the detached HEAD

Go back to the branch HEAD
```{console}
% git switch -                    
Previous HEAD position was 21a3b5a Merge pull request #2 from gerkovink/gerkodev
Switched to branch 'Exercise_wk4'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/Exercise_wk4'.
```

---

# Make a new branch of the old state

Let's take that old state and make it into a proper point of departure for new things. Again, reference `21a3b5ac1535703f4ce0d6feb2ccf3703f95eee3 Merge pull request #2 from gerkovink/gerkodev`, but now we make the state of `21a3b5a` into a new branch. We call that branch `Wk4_markup`: 

```{console}
% git checkout -b Wk4_markup 21a3b5a 
Switched to a new branch 'Wk4_markup'
```

We now have checked out an old state and made it into a new branch. The cool thing is that we can now commit all we want and everything will be properly logged. Just remember that if you'd like to go back in time and play around with an old state of your project --> **Merge the old state into a new branch** like I demonstrated above. 

---

# Add a new commit

We start by creating an empty text file
```{console}
% touch add_text_file.txt
```

If the `touch` command does not work on your machine, you may also create this file by hand. 

Now, if we would like to commit the addition of this file to our repo, we get the following:
```{console}
% git commit -a -m 'add text file'
On branch Wk4_markup
Untracked files:
	add_text_file.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present
```

The commit was not succesfull, because the file `add_text_file.txt` is not yet tracked. Note that I use `-a` to specify to commit **all** changed files and folders that are tracked. I use `-m` to indicate that I would like to add the message `add text file`. 

You see that using a GUI to `git` like GitHub desktop or RStudio is quite convenient if you would not like to indicate which files to track. It is also less flexible. 

---

## Add files to tracking
To track all untracked files and folders
```{console}
git add -A
```

---

## commit with a message
Now if we revisit the commit command
```{console}
% git commit -a -m 'add text file'
[Wk4_markup 8d30c46] add text file
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 add_text_file.txt
```

We can see that the HEAD is now at the latest commit and that this commit comes after the old-state from which we created the branch. 

---

## Now add another empty text file. 

```{console}
% touch add_another_text_file.txt
```

Let's say that we rather would have included this file in the previous commit, we can achieve this by 

```{console}

We have effectively ammended the previous commit. We've also changed the commit message into `add two text files`:

# Undo a commit
When shit hits the fan, we can always undo a commit. For example, the following command reverts all changes to the inital commit
```{console}
% git reset --hard 493609e  
HEAD is now at 493609e Initial commit
```

We are now back at the first commit in the project. 

# Undo undoing a commit
To properly do this without making mistakes, it is best to study the history of the HEAD
```{console}
% git reflog                
493609e (HEAD -> Wk4_markup) HEAD@{0}: reset: moving to 493609e
9e6c38c HEAD@{1}: commit (amend): add two text files
8d30c46 HEAD@{2}: commit: add text file
21a3b5a (old-state) HEAD@{3}: checkout: moving from Exercise_wk4 to Wk4_markup
176137b (origin/master, origin/HEAD, origin/Exercise_wk4, master, Exercise_wk4) HEAD@{4}: checkout: moving from Exercise_wk4 to Exercise_wk4
176137b (origin/master, origin/HEAD, origin/Exercise_wk4, master, Exercise_wk4) HEAD@{5}: checkout: moving from old-state to Exercise_wk4
21a3b5a (old-state) HEAD@{6}: checkout: moving from Exercise_wk4 to old-state
176137b (origin/master, origin/HEAD, origin/Exercise_wk4, master, Exercise_wk4) HEAD@{7}: checkout: moving from 21a3b5ac1535703f4ce0d6feb2ccf3703f95eee3 to Exercise_wk4
21a3b5a (old-state) HEAD@{8}: checkout: moving from Exercise_wk4 to 21a3b5a
176137b (origin/master, origin/HEAD, origin/Exercise_wk4, master, Exercise_wk4) HEAD@{9}: checkout: moving from 21a3b5ac1535703f4ce0d6feb2ccf3703f95eee3 to Exercise_wk4
21a3b5a (old-state) HEAD@{10}: checkout: moving from Exercise_wk4 to 21a3b
176137b (origin/master, origin/HEAD, origin/Exercise_wk4, master, Exercise_wk4) HEAD@{11}: checkout: moving from 21a3b5ac1535703f4ce0d6feb2ccf3703f95eee3 to Exercise_wk4
21a3b5a (old-state) HEAD@{12}: checkout: moving from Exercise_wk4 to 21a3b5a
176137b (origin/master, origin/HEAD, origin/Exercise_wk4, master, Exercise_wk4) HEAD@{13}: checkout: moving from master to Exercise_wk4
176137b (origin/master, origin/HEAD, origin/Exercise_wk4, master, Exercise_wk4) HEAD@{14}: checkout: moving from Exercise_wk4 to master
176137b (origin/master, origin/HEAD, origin/Exercise_wk4, master, Exercise_wk4) HEAD@{15}: checkout: moving from Exercise_wk4 to Exercise_wk4
176137b (origin/master, origin/HEAD, origin/Exercise_wk4, master, Exercise_wk4) HEAD@{16}: checkout: moving from master to Exercise_wk4
176137b (origin/master, origin/HEAD, origin/Exercise_wk4, master, Exercise_wk4) HEAD@{17}: checkout: moving from SofieIssue to master
1f488c6 (SofieIssue) HEAD@{18}: commit: remove pipe operator
4ead406 HEAD@{19}: commit: update readme.md
```

We are now looking at the reflog - the log of where the HEAD has been. It used to be at 

```{console}
9e6c38c HEAD@{1}: commit (amend): add two text files
```

but is now at 

```{console}
493609e (HEAD -> Wk4_markup) HEAD@{0}: reset: moving to 493609e
```

We can use this history of where the head has been to go back to the previous step. In other words, if we would like to undo a commit, we can always go back to the previous HEAD stage --> the HEAD has been moved one step forward by the commit. Likewise, if we would like to undo a hard reset, we can also go back to the previous HEAD stage --> the HEAD has been moved one step forward by the reset. 

To undo it all, we can use the indicator that is referenced by the `reflog`:

```{console}
% git reset --hard HEAD@{1}
HEAD is now at 9e6c38c add two text files
```

Using `reflog` and HEAD is in this case more flexible than using `log` and the SHA-1 hash. `reflog` yields the log of all changes in the pointer HEAD, while `log` only gives you the history of the logged commits. Once a commit is undone, it is gone from the `log`. Moreover, using `reflog` and HEAD allows you to go back into the future, like in the above example. 

**NOTE: Do not wait too long to undo your resets. After a few days/weeks garbage collection may kick in and `git` will eventually see old commit as unreferenced. This makes them irretrievable**

---

# Redo a commit
A hard reset brings you back to a previous state. It loses all changes that have been committed since. If you'd like to undo a single commit and erase the commit message, but not throw out the modifications:

```{console}
git reset --soft 493609e 
```

We are now back at the initial commit, but all changes since have been staged. We can commit these changes as

```{console}
% git commit -a -m 'everything in a single commit'
[Wk4_markup 525efa5] everything in a single commit
 7 files changed, 36 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)
 create mode 100644 Gerko/Assignment 1/Vink.jpg
 create mode 100644 Gerko/Assignment 1/Vink.pdf
 create mode 100644 README.Rmd
 create mode 100644 add_text_file.txt
 create mode 100644 markup_sticker_SMALL.png
```

If we study the log, we find that there are now only two commits. 
```{console}
% git log --pretty=oneline                        
5fe2c1bd44b1dbc92172b85dec3d87ced7073deb (HEAD -> Wk4_markup) everything in a single commit
493609efa7ce659ebebf5a0d0300f23788397e68 Initial commit
```

# Merging branches
Let's see if we can merge the `Wk4_markup` branch into the `Exercise_wk4` branch. 

First we need to checkout the branch we would like to merge into:
```{console}
% git checkout Exercise_wk4
Updating files: 100% (174/174), done.
Switched to branch 'Exercise_wk4'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/Exercise_wk4'.
```

Then we can attempt to merge:
```{console}
% git merge Wk4_markup   
Auto-merging README.md
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in README.md
CONFLICT (add/add): Merge conflict in README.Rmd
Auto-merging README.Rmd
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

We've now effectively created a conflict. A conflict must be resolved before a merge is possible. If you switch to GiHub desktop, you'll see this pop-up

![](conflict.png)

You can use the drop-down menu to choose either modified file version as the one to keep after merging (which means you'll throw out the other version from the other branch)

![](resolve.png)

There is also the option to open the file in the editor and manually resolve the conflict. 

![](conflictdetail.png)

We now see the detail about this conflict. Remember that we took an old state as our point of departure? After that point I have changed the header of the `Readme.Rmd` file. This conflict needs to be resolved before we can merge these branches. 

---

## Resolve the conflict
Choose `Wk4_markup` as the reference. Throw out the version from `Exercise_wk4`. You can do this manually or by choosing the following drop-down item in GitHub Desktop:

![](dropdown.png)
After that, we can stage the changes and commit them in the `Exercise_wk4` branch:
```{console}
% git add -A
% git commit -m 'conflict resolved'
```

---

# Hand in your exercise

1. Take the merged `Exercise_wk4` branch as your point of departure
2. Create a new branch named `Wk4_yourname`
3. Change the filename of the text file to `yourname.txt`
4. Stage the changes
5. Commit the changes with a custom message
6. Publish your branch on GitHub
7. Do a pull request that can be automatically merged. 
8. Post an issue in this year's Repo, wherin you reference your PR to last year's repo.

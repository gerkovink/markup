Dear all, 

This week we'll extend the knowledge we have about `rmarkdown` to generate presentations in `html` and `pdf` format. We've seen in week 4 that `RStudio`'s `markdown` implementation is a very quick and convenient language to quickly mark up text documents and, if necessary, to include images, mathematical equations ($\LaTeX$) and to display and/or execute code (`R`, `Python`, etc). 

Let's take `rmarkdown` a step further.

Best, 

Gerko

# `rmarkdown` for presentations
Generating presentations with `markdown` is very much like marking up regular documents in `markdown`. However, there are some minor differences:

First, presentations usually follow some form of dimensionality that adheres to display conventions: screen dimensions are historically obeying to `4:3` or `16:9` aspect ratios, although recent trends do allow for wider `18:9` or `21:9` aspect ratios. The benefit of marking up regular `html` documents with `rmarkdown` is the natural scaling of content to the device. With `pdf`'s the resulting document is paginated and follows a strict canvas size (e.g. A4, US letter, etc) suitable for printing. 

Second, output options need to be explicitly formulated. There are multiple implementations for generating `html` presentations and, when the output is set to `pdf`, the `beamer` specifications have to be declared.

Third, the pound sign `#` is still used for (sub)sections, but the leveling is very important: a single `#` indicates a new chapter in your presentation, a double `##` indicates a new slide within that chapter.

## Different forms of output
RStudio supports the following slide output styles:

- `html` ioslides: My preferred mode of creating presentations. See [this page](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/ioslides_presentation_format.html) for a detailed how-to.
- `html` slidy: Another flexible mode of creating presentations. See [this page](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/slidy_presentation_format.html) for a detailed how-to.
- `pdf` beamer. See [this page](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/beamer_presentation_format.html) for a detailed how-to.

I suggest you take a look at these output styles and pick a style. You can always switch later on and have your `rmarkdown` document generate a different style.

## References

See [this page](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html) on a detailed walkthrough about how `rmarkdown` handles bibliographies and citations. 

---

## Interactive graphs
With package [`plotly`](https://plot.ly/r/), any graphics generated by [`ggplot2`](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/) can become interactive in `html` output files. 
It is adviced to install the developer version of `ggplot2` from `GitHub`. You can do so by running
```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github('hadley/ggplot2')
```

An example:
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
require(plotly)
set.seed(123)

df <- data.frame(x <- rchisq(1000, 5, 10),
                 group <- sample(LETTERS[1:5], size = 1000, replace = T))

p <- ggplot(df, aes(x, fill = group)) + 
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5, position = "stack") + 
  ggtitle("stacked density chart")

ggplotly(p)
```

---

## Interactive tables
With package [`DT`](http://rstudio.github.io/DT/), any table in `R` can become interactive in `html` output files. An example that outputs the first 5 rows by default:
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
require(DT)
datatable(mtcars, options = list(pageLength = 5))
```

---

## FlowCharts and Diagrams
[`DiagrammeR`](http://rich-iannone.github.io/DiagrammeR/) it is straightforward to generate flow charts from within any `rmarkdown` document. An example flowchart:
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(DiagrammeR)
grViz("
  digraph {
    layout = twopi
    node [shape = circle]
    A -> {B C D} 
    B -> {C D}
    D -> {A B}
  }")
```

Or, more complicated:
```{r}
grViz("
  digraph dot {

    graph [compound = true, nodesep = .5, ranksep = .25,
           color = crimson, label='Polynomial Regression Model'
           /*, rankdir='LR', style=filled, fillcolor = blue*/
          ]

    subgraph cluster1 {
      node [shape = diamond, 
            color = black]
      xi

      node [shape = circle,
            style = filled,
            fillcolor = grey] 
      ti
      
      edge [color = black] 
      xi -> ti

      label='N'
    }  
  
    node [shape = circle]
    w

    node [shape = diamond,
          color = black,
          label = '&alpha;']
    alpha

    node [shape = diamond,
          color = black,
          label = '&sigma;&#x00B2;']
    sigma

    edge [color = black]
    alpha -> w
    w -> ti
    sigma -> ti 

  }
  ",
engine = "dot")
```

An example diagram sequence with `DiagrammeR`:
```{r}
DiagrammeR("
sequenceDiagram;
   customer->>ticket seller: ask ticket;
   ticket seller->>database: seats;
   alt tickets available
     database->>ticket seller: ok;
     ticket seller->>customer: confirm;
     customer->>ticket seller: ok;
     ticket seller->>database: book a seat;
     ticket seller->>printer: print ticket;
   else sold out
     database->>ticket seller: none left;
     ticket seller->>customer:  sorry;
   end
")
```

## `htmlwidgets` for `R`

Have a look at the [`htmlwidgets`](http://www.htmlwidgets.org/index.html) website to lear all about referencing, tweaking, linking, using and misusing a variety of html widgets in `rmarkdown`.

# Exercise

Create a presentation about any topic you like that consists of at least 7 slides and includes all of the following:

- a logo
- a centered still figure
- an interactive table
- a moving figure, interactive figure or movie
- a 2-column slide
- an aligned multi-row equation
- a citation and reference list
- r-code, displayed but not executed
- cached r-code (may overlap with the next requirement)
- r-code, executed, but not displayed (e.g. a figure generation)

Of course this presentation may serve as the basis for presentations that you may have to create for other courses. Submit the presentation to this year's GitHub repo.

Dear all, 

In this exercise we will learn how to use $\LaTeX$ to reference our citations and sections. Later on, we will also learn how to refer to Figures and Tables. 

Let's start.

# Referencing in `Tex`
There are two general (read: widely used) ways of referencing in `Tex`:

1. The standard citation environment in Tex
2. The [`natbib`](http://merkel.zoneo.net/Latex/natbib.php?lang=en) citation environment
3. The [`biblatex`](https://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex?lang=en) citation environment

The difference between the implementations is in the level of customization. The standard citation environment is simple, but limited. `natbib` allows you to customize pretty much anything and `biblatex` provides an easier and more flexible interface and a better language localization that the other two options. The good thing is that the three implementations use the same sources; only the calls differ:

- to cite a publication in `tex`, use `\cite{}` to produce a `(Author, year)` reference, and use `\citeA{}` to produce a `Author (year)` reference (at least in APA style). 
- in `natbib`, `\citep{}` produces the `(Author, year)` reference and `\citet{}` yields the `Author (year)` reference (when using APA style)
- in `biblatex`, you are better off with [this cheat sheet](http://tug.ctan.org/info/biblatex-cheatsheet/biblatex-cheatsheet.pdf) to explore the possibilities

So, why not use thestandard citation environment? First, the additional packages work with the `hyperref` package, which you should always use (see [Exercise 1](https://www.gerkovink.com/Markup-Programming/Wk1/Exercise%201/Exercise_1.html)). Second, depending on the target journal for any research project, style conventions for referencing may differ. For example, in medicinal sciences the convention is to use numbered references (such as [1], [2] and [3-5]). In psychology, people adhere to the APA rules and references are adressed in so-called author-year style. `natbib` allows you to very quickly specify these styles, without any hassle. The standard citation environment does not fully allow for such implementations. Third, many journals use `natbib` themselves. So if you acquire the style files from the journal, you do not have to change all the `\cite{}`'s and `\citeA{}`'s. This is also the reason why I will focus primarily on `natbib` in this course: Even though `biblatex` is more flexible; it has not been adopted by our community yet. Plus, you can use `natbib`'s citation environment in `biblatex`.

# BibTex
BibTeX is reference management software for formatting lists of references. Bluntly stolen from wikipedia: 

---

Here’s how BibTeX works. It takes as input

a. an `.aux` file produced by LaTeX on an earlier run;
b. a `.bst` file (the style file), which specifies the general reference-list style and specifies how to format individual entries, and which is written by a style designer [..] in a special-purpose language [..], and
c. `.bib` file(s) constituting a database of all reference-list entries the user might ever hope to use.
      
BibTeX chooses from the `.bib` file(s) only those entries specified by the `.aux` file (that is, those given by LaTeX's \cite or \nocite commands), and creates as output a `.bbl` file containing these entries together with the formatting commands specified by the `.bst` file. LaTeX will use the `.bbl` file, perhaps edited by the user, to produce the reference list.

---

In other words; you have a global bibliography (library) - or a seperate bibliography for each project, if you wish -  with all your references. This is your `.bib` file. When you run `tex`, an `.aux` file is produced. If you reference to something in your text, these citations will be recorded in the `.aux` file. `bibtex` will match the citations in your `.aux` file to those in the specified `.bib` file (and produce an error if you reference somthing that is not in your `.bib` file) to produce a `.bbl` file that specifically matches the bibliography style (e.g. numbers, APA style, sorted, alphabetized, etc.) that you have specified in `tex`. If you re-run your `tex` code now, the references will be printed in your pdf. 

Have a look at the manuscript in the `\Latex background` folder in this week's course page folder for an example of a `natbib` implementation. Especially take a look at the `.bib` and `.bbl` files. See e.g. [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX) for a list of all possible citation elements you can refer to with `bibtex`. 

## Re-running `tex` after `bibtex`
This is important. In fact, it is so important (and a common error by students and experts) that I devote a seperate paragraph to it! `bibtex` and `tex` are NOT the same and their code has not by default run simultaneously --> you need the following order:

1. compile (or set) your `tex` code
2. compile your `bibtex` environment
3. re-compile your `tex` code to include the stuff `bibtex` produced
3. re-compile your `tex` code to process and print the `tex` vs `bibtex` implementation

Depending on the software you use to write in `tex`, you can automate this procedure to always include `bibtex` when compiling your `tex` code. I choose not too, but that is my personal preference (running redundant commands every time is just a waste of time and resources, even when it is fast). But 'whatever floats your boat'.

# Reference managers
There is a lot of specialized software to manage your bibliographies. Such software would allow you to import `bibtex` entries from search engines such as Google Scholar and assign your own reference key to each publication. You need a good reference manager if you work with `bibtex`. If you are on Windows/Linux, I would suggest [JabRef](http://jabref.sourceforge.net/). If you are on a Mac, the [BibDesk](http://bibdesk.sourceforge.net/) reference manager that is included in the MacTex distribution would be perfect. These are suggestions. There are many more reference managers. Again; whatever floats your boat. 

So let's start the exercises.

# Exercise

If you missed it earlier; [here](http://merkel.zoneo.net/Latex/natbib.php?lang=en) you can find a very useful `natbib` reference sheet. For all exercises, use the `exercises.bib` bibliography and the `bib_template.tex` file from the course page. Specify the references such that you obtain the desired output. 

---

1. Have a look at [this `biblatex` page](https://nl.sharelatex.com/learn/Bibliography_management_in_LaTeX) and [this `natbib` page](https://nl.sharelatex.com/learn/Bibliography_management_with_natbib) for even more detail on `natbib` and `biblatex`. 
2. See how in the `bib_template.tex` file the first line of Section 2 refers back to Section 1 through `\ref{label}`.
3. Study the examples in the `Latex background/Examples` folder. Especially study the example `Example4_natbib numbered.tex` as it provides you with a way of enclosing your bibliography in your `tex` file. Some journals require this. 

Create five documents:

1. Produce a document named `Ex2V0.pdf` based on `bib_template.tex` with numbered references that are sorted alphabetically, but not compressed
2. Produce a document named `Ex2V1.pdf` with numbered references that are sorted on order of appearance, but not compressed.
3. Produce a document named `Ex2V2.pdf` with numbered references that are sorted on order of appearance and compressed.
4. Produce a document named `Ex2V3.pdf` document in APA style. Make sure that reference URL's are printed in the References Section. 
5. Produce a document named `Ex2V4.pdf` document in APA style, with references highlighted in black. 

You may use `biblatex` or `natbib` interchangeably. Upload the documents to [SurfDrive](https://surfdrive.surf.nl/files/index.php/s/tiBnPyIZy8B9w73) before the next lecture starts. I will post the code solutions after that lecture.

# About the course

## Format
- Some Wednesdays till the end of the year:
  
    - 9 am - noon
    - Online
    - The first part of every meeting will be a lecture. 
    - Every second part will be hands-on / Q&A

If you cannot make a meeting; I'd like to know beforehand. 

### **I'd strongly suggest to participate in every meeting**

## Schedule
| When?   |      | Where? | What?                                   |
|:--------|:-----|:-------|:----------------------------------------|
|  16-Sep | 9 am | Online | Monte Carlo simulation and `Git` |
|  30-Sep | 9 am | Online | Reproducible workflows and replication|
|  28-Oct | 9 am | Online | Typesetting equations with `LaTeX` |
|  04-Nov | 9 am | Online | Version control and `Github` in depth |
|  25-Nov | 9 am | Online | Presentations with `rMarkdown` |
|  09-Dec | 9 am | Online | `Github pages` and `Shiny` |


## Exercises
To develop the necessary skills for completing this course, 6 exercises must be made and submitted:

- These exercises are not graded, but students must fulfill them to pass the course. 
- Exercises have to be handed in **before** the next meeting.
- Answers will be posted after the next meeting.

## Grading {.smaller}
The final grade is computed as follows:

| Graded part       | Weight      |
|:-------|:------|
| Markup manuscript | 50 % |
| Research repository | 40 % |
| Personal repository | 10 % |

### Good to know
Grading considers concepts like visual appearance, readability, usefulness, efficiency of the code. *Grading does not consider the theoretical or quantitative properties or scientific quality of the content*!
  
## Contact
If you need any help during this course, do one of the following

1. Google seems to have a lot of answers if you present it with the right question
2. Open a Github Issue in the course `GitHub` page. The holy grail in discussion about collaborative development. I'd prefer plenary discussions for problems, because your unique problem usually is less unique than you might think. 
3. If you really have to: send an e-mail at `G.Vink@uu.nl` containing your question or issue.

Questions that are beyond the scope of the course are also welcome!


- Always post your coding/development issue with a [MWE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_Working_Example) or [`reprex`](https://github.com/tidyverse/reprex).

## Goal of this course {.smaller}

***Learn the skills and tools to present yourself and your work.***

**Useful for**: a phd, career in data science, being at the state-of-the-art in markup programming. 

**What to do** (not in any definitive order)

1. Perform a (monte carlo) simulation study
2. Create a scientific manuscript 
3. Program your simulation such that it creates a data archive
4. Publish this archive to GitHub
5. Tell people about yourself on GitHub
6. Showcase your findings through a shiny web-app
7. Make absolutely sure that others can retrace your steps
8. Be able to replicate it all

## Some useful info

`GitHub` offers a GitHub Student Developer Pack, including a free `Github` PRO account for as long as you are a student

# `Git`

## Why Git

At this point in the lecture I will ramble on about how awesome `Git` and `GitHub` is. 

# Monte Carlo methods

## Monte Carlo simulation

- repeated sampling
- use randomness
- solve problems

## Throwing a fair die
```{r}
set.seed(123)
1/6
sample(1:6, 1000000, replace = TRUE) %>% 
  table %>% prop.table
replicate(1000, 
          sample(1:6, 1000, replace = TRUE)) %>% 
  table %>% prop.table
```

## Throwing an unfair die
```{r}
sample(1:6, 1000000, replace = TRUE, prob = c(.1, .1, .1, .4, .2, .1)) %>% 
  table %>% 
  prop.table
replicate(1000, 
          sample(1:6, 1000, replace = TRUE, 
                 prob = c(.1, .1, .1, .4, .2, .1))) %>% 
  table %>% 
  prop.table
```

## Sampling distribution
```{r fig.height=3.5}
replicate(1000, rnorm(10), simplify = FALSE) %>%
  lapply(var) %>% unlist %>%
  density %>% plot
```

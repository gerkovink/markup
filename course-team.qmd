I am a statistician masquerading as a dark data scientist with a passion for educating people. I aim to be at the cutting edge of both teaching and research and have an interest in new developments concerning the presentation of data, results and knowledge. I have a specific interest for problems where not all data is available (some information is left in the dark), information privacy, computational evaluation and programming. I am based in the Netherlands and work as an associate professor at Utrecht University (Utrecht, Netherlands).

I live my life with a wife and two kids, a surfboard and a pair of hiking shoes. You can reach me via e-mail at [g.vink\@uu.nl](mailto:g.vink@uu.nl)

Hanne Oberman is my (see above) PhD student. Hanne is a key figure in Utrecht's Open Science Community and has a knack for new developments in creating and maintaining robust software. Hanne is a contributor and developer to multiple R-packages, some of which are in the top 10 packages developed at Utrecht University. Oh, and Hanne is much too polite, which is why I wrote this text on her behalf. You can reach Hanne at [h.i.oberman\@uu.nl](mailto:h.i.oberman@uu.nl)

# Deliverables {.unnumbered}


This year we're shaking things up. To avoid any confusion about the deliverables for this course and to structure all our thoughts and efforts, we have created [a wonderful template repository](https://github.com/hanneoberman/markup_deliverables/tree/dev) for this course.

## What to hand in {#sec-deliv}
Fork [this template repository](https://github.com/hanneoberman/markup_deliverables/tree/dev) following the flow below. You'll end up with a copy of the repository template on your GitHub account, with the full course exercise and deliverable structure in the `dev` branch. The full rationale about GitHub and branching will be explained in more detail in this course.

# Reproducibility

## Research process

![](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/_images/reproducibility.jpg)

## Definition

![](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/_images/reproducible-matrix.jpg)

"A result is reproducible when the same analysis steps performed on the same dataset consistently produces the same answer".^[[The Turing way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/overview/overview-definitions#rr-overview-definitions)]

## Reproducibility rate

Reproducible research is not the norm: "74% of `R` files failed to complete without error" ([Trisovic, Lau, Pasquier, et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-022-01143-6)) 

<!-- 9000 unique R files published from 2010 to 2020 -->

## Making research reproducible

- reproducible documents
- research compendiums

# Research Compendiums

## Research compendium

::: {.column width="45%"}
- "A research compendium is a collection of all digital parts of a research project including 
  - data, 
  - code, 
  - texts
  - ...
- The collection is created in such a way that reproducing all results is straightforward"[^1]
- "The compendium serves as a means for distributing, managing, and updating the collection"[^2]

## In practice

Research Data Management Support workshop: 

**Writing Reproducible Manuscripts in R and Python**

## Things

- "Completeness: The research compendium contains all of the objects needed to reproduce a predefined outcome.
- Organization: It is easy to understand and keep track of the various objects in the research compendium and their relationship over time.
- Economy: Fewer extraneous objects in the compendium mean fewer things that can break and require less maintenance over time.
- Transparency: The research compendium provides full disclosure of the research process that produced the scientific claim.
- Documentation: Information describing compendium objects is provided in enough detail to enable independent understanding and use of the compendium".[^3]

## Things

- "Access: It is clear who can use what, how, and under what conditions, with open access preferred.
- Provenance: The origin of the components of the research compendium and how each has changed over time is evident.
- Metadata: Information about the research compendium and its components is embedded in a standardized, machine-readable code.
- Automation: As much as possible, the computational workflow is script- or workflow-based so that the workflow can be re-executed using minimal actions.
- Review: A series of managed activities needed to ensure continued access to and functionality of the research compendium and its components for as long as necessary".[^3]

## Steps

- Think about a good folder structure 
  - Split up 'read-only', 'human-generated', and 'project-generated' files
- Create folder structure (main directory and sub directories)
  - Add a landing page in the form of a README document
  - Make the compendium executable (to automatically generate the results; optional)
  - Make the compendium into a git repository (optional)
- Add all files needed for reproducing the results of the project
  - Avoid 'hard coded' parameters or human intervention in the execution
- Make the compendium as clean and easy to use as possible
  - Include a citation file and a LICENSE file with info on how it can be used
- Publish your compendium[^4]

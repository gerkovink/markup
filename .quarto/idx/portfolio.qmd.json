That is your final project.*\n\nThe goal of the final project is for you to use regression analysis to analyze a data set of your own choosing.\nThe data set may already exist or you may collect your own data by scraping the web.\n\nChoose the data based on your group's interests or work you all have done in other courses or research projects.\nThe goal of this project is for you to demonstrate proficiency in the techniques we have covered in this class (and beyond, if you like!) and apply them to a data set to analyze it in a meaningful way.\n\nAll analyses must be done in RStudio, and all components of the project **must be reproducible** (with the exception of the presentation).\n\n### Logistics\n\nYou will work on the project with your lab groups.\n\nThe four primary deliverables for the final project are\n\n-   A written, reproducible report detailing your analysis\n-   A GitHub repository corresponding to your report\n-   Slides + a video presentation\n-   Formal peer review on another team's project\n\n## Topic ideas {#topic-ideas}\n\nIdentify 2-3 data sets you're interested in potentially using for the final project.\nIf you're unsure where to find data, you can use the list of potential data sources in the [Tips + Resources](#tips--resources) section as a starting point.\nIt may also help to think of topics you're interested in investigating and find data sets on those topics.\n\nThe purpose of submitting project ideas is to give you time to find data for the project and to make sure you have a data set that can help you be successful in the project.\n**Therefore, you must use one of the data sets submitted as a topic idea, unless otherwise notified by the teaching team.**\n\nThe data sets should meet the following criteria:\n\n-   At least 500 observations\n\n-   At least 10 columns\n\n-   At least 6 of the columns must be useful and unique predictor variables.\n\n    -   Identifier variables such as \"name\", \"social security number\", etc. are not useful predictor variables.\n    -   If you have multiple columns with the same information (e.g. \"state abbreviation\" and \"state name\"), then they are not unique predictors.\n\n-   At least one variable that can be identified as a reasonable response variable.\n\n    -   The response variable can be quantitative or categorical.\n\n-   A mix of quantitative and categorical variables that can be used as predictors.\n\n-   Observations should reasonably meet the independence condition.\n    Therefore, avoid data with repeated measures, data collected over time, etc.\n\n-   You may not use data that has previously been used in any course materials, or any derivation of data that has been used in course materials.\n\n**Please ask a member of the teaching team if you're unsure whether your data set meets the criteria.**\n\nFor each data set, include the following:\n\n#### Introduction and data\n\n-   State the source of the data set.\n-   Describe when and how it was originally collected (by the original data curator, not necessarily how you found the data)\n-   Describe the observations and the general characteristics being measured in the data\n\n#### Research question\n\n-   Describe a research question you're interested in answering using this data.\n\n#### Glimpse of data\n\n-   Use the `glimpse` function to provide an overview of each data set\n\nSubmit the PDF of the topic ideas to Gradescope.\nMark all pages associated with each data set.\n\n## Project proposal {#project-proposal}\n\nThe purpose of the project proposal is to help you think about your analysis strategy early.\n\nInclude the following in the proposal:\n\n### Section 1 - Introduction\n\nThe introduction section includes\n\n-   an introduction to the subject matter you're investigating\n-   the motivation for your research question (citing any relevant literature)\n-   the general research question you wish to explore\n-   your hypotheses regarding the research question of interest.\n\n### Section 2 - Data description\n\nIn this section, you will describe the data set you wish to explore.\nThis includes\n\n-   description of the observations in the data set,\n-   description of how the data was originally collected (not how you found the data but how the original curator of the data collected it).\n\n### Section 3 - Analysis approach\n\nIn this section, you will provide a brief overview of your analysis approach.\nThis includes:\n\n-   Description of the response variable.\n-   Visualization and summary statistics for the response variable.\n-   List of variables that will be considered as predictors\n-   Regression model technique (multiple linear regression and logistic regression)\n\n### Data dictionary (aka code book)\n\nSubmit a data dictionary for all the variables in your data set in the `README` of your project repo, in the `data` folder.\nLink to this file from your proposal writeup.\n\n### Submission\n\nPush all of your final changes to the GitHub repo, and submit the PDF of your proposal to Gradescope.\n\n### Proposal grading\n\n| Total                | 10 pts |\n|----------------------|--------|\n| **Introduction**     | 3 pts  |\n| **Data description** | 2 pts  |\n| **Analysis plan**    | 4 pts  |\n| **Data dictionary**  | 1 pts  |\n\nEach component will be graded as follows:\n\n-   **Meets expectations (full credit)**: All required elements are completed and are accurate.\n    The narrative is written clearly, all tables and visualizations are nicely formatted, and the work would be presentable in a professional setting.\n\n-   **Close to expectations (half credit)**: There are some elements missing and/or inaccurate.\n    There are some issues with formatting.\n\n-   **Does not meet expectations (no credit)**: Major elements missing.\n    Work is not neatly formatted and would not be presentable in a professional setting.\n\n## Draft report {#draft-report}\n\nThe purpose of the draft and peer review is to give you an opportunity to get early feedback on your analysis.\nTherefore, the draft and peer review will focus primarily on the exploratory data analysis, modeling, and initial interpretations.\n\nWrite the draft in the **written-report.qmd** file in your project repo.\nYou do not need to submit the draft on Gradescope.\n\nBelow is a brief description of the sections to focus on in the draft:\n\n### Introduction and data\n\nThis section includes an introduction to the project motivation, data, and research question.\nDescribe the data and definitions of key variables.\nIt should also include some exploratory data analysis.\nAll of the EDA won't fit in the paper, so focus on the EDA for the response variable and a few other interesting variables and relationships.\n\n### Methodology\n\nThis section includes a brief description of your modeling process.\nExplain the reasoning for the type of model you're fitting, predictor variables considered for the model including any interactions.\nAdditionally, show how you arrived at the final model by describing the model selection process, any variable transformations (if needed), and any other relevant considerations that were part of the model fitting process.\n\n### Results\n\nIn this section, you will output the final model and include a brief discussion of the model assumptions, diagnostics, and any relevant model fit statistics.\n\nThis section also includes initial interpretations and conclusions drawn from the model.\n\n## Peer review {#peer-review}\n\nCritically reviewing others' work is a crucial part of the scientific process, and STA 210 is no exception.\nEach lab team will be assigned two other teams's projects to review.\nEach team should push their draft to their GitHub repo by the due date.\nOne lab in the following week will be dedicated to the peer review, and all reviews will be due by the end of that lab session.\n\nDuring the peer review process, you will be provided read-only access to your partner teams' GitHub repos.\nProvide your review in the form of GitHub issues to your partner team's GitHub repo using the issue template provided.\nThe peer review will be graded on the extent to which it comprehensively and constructively addresses the components of the partner team's report: the research context and motivation, exploratory data analysis, modeling, interpretations, and conclusions.\n\n### Pairings\n\n#### Section 1 -

You should already have access to this team's repo.\n-   Open the repo of the team you're reviewing, read their project draft, and browser around the rest of their repo.\n-   Then, go to the Issues tab in that repo, click on New issue, and click on Get started for the Peer review issue. Fill out this issue, answering the following questions:\n    -   Peer review by: \\[NAME OF TEAM DOING THE REVIEW\\]\n\n    -   Names of team members that participated in this review: \\[FULL NAMES OF TEAM MEMBERS DOING THE REVIEW\\]\n\n    -   Describe the goal of the project.\n\n    -   Describe the data used or collected, if any.\n        If the proposal does not include the use of a specific dataset, comment on whether the project would be strengthened by the inclusion of a dataset.\n\n    -   Describe the approaches, tools, and methods that will be used.\n\n    -   Is there anything that is unclear from the proposal?\n\n    -   Provide constructive feedback on how the team might be able to improve their project.\n        Make sure your feedback includes at least one comment on the statistical modeling aspect of the project, but do feel free to comment on aspects beyond the modeling.\n\n    -   What aspect of this project are you most interested in and would like to see highlighted in the presentation.\n\n    -   Provide constructive feedback on any issues with file and/or code organization.\n\n    -   (Optional) Any further comments or feedback?\n\n## Written report {#written-report}\n\nYour written report must be completed in the `written-report.qmd` file and must be reproducible.\nAll team members should contribute to the GitHub repository, with regular meaningful commits.\n\nBefore you finalize your write up, make sure the printing of code chunks is off with the option `echo = FALSE`.\n\n**You will submit the PDF of your final report on Gradescope.**\n\nThe PDF you submit must match the files in your GitHub repository *exactly*.\nThe mandatory components of the report are below.\nYou are free to add additional sections as necessary.\nThe report, including visualizations, should be **no more than 10 pages long.** is no minimum page requirement; however, you should comprehensively address all of the analysis and report.\n\nBe selective in what you include in your final write-up.\nThe goal is to write a cohesive narrative that demonstrates a thorough and comprehensive analysis rather than explain every step of the analysis.\n\nYou are welcome to include an appendix with additional work at the end of the written report document; however, grading will largely be based on the content in the main body of the report.\nYou should assume the reader will not see the material in the appendix unless prompted to view it in the main body of the report.\nThe appendix should be neatly formatted and easy for the reader to navigate.\nIt is not included in the 10-page limit.\n\nThe written report is worth 40 points, broken down as follows\n\n| Total                         | 40 pts |\n|-------------------------------|--------|\n| **Introduction/data**         | 6 pts  |\n| **Methodology**               | 10 pts |\n| **Results**                   | 14 pts |\n| **Discussion + conclusion**   | 6 pts  |\n| **Organization + formatting** | 4 pts  |\n\n[Click here](/documents/project-report-rubric.pdf \"Project rubric\") for a PDF of the written report rubric.\n\n### Introduction and data\n\nThis section includes an introduction to the project motivation, data, and research question.\nDescribe the data and definitions of key variables.\nIt should also include some exploratory data analysis.\nAll of the EDA won't fit in the paper, so focus on the EDA for the response variable and a few other interesting variables and relationships.\n\n#### Grading criteria\n\nThe research question and motivation are clearly stated in the introduction, including citations for the data source and any external research.\nThe data are clearly described, including a description about how the data were originally collected and a concise definition of the variables relevant to understanding the report.\nThe data cleaning process is clearly described, including any decisions made in the process (e.g., creating new variables, removing observations, etc.) The explanatory data analysis helps the reader better understand the observations in the data along with interesting and relevant relationships between the variables.\nIt incorporates appropriate visualizations and summary statistics.\n\n### Methodology\n\nThis section includes a brief description of your modeling process.\nExplain the reasoning for the type of model you're fitting, predictor variables considered for the model including any interactions.\nAdditionally, show how you arrived at the final model by describing the model selection process, interactions considered, variable transformations (if needed), assessment of conditions and diagnostics, and any other relevant considerations that were part of the model fitting process.\n\n#### Grading criteria\n\nThe analysis steps are appropriate for the data and research question.\nThe group used a thorough and careful approach to select the final model; the approach is clearly described in the report.\nThe model selection process took into account potential interaction effects and addressed any violations in model conditions.\nThe model conditions and diagnostics are thoroughly and accurately assessed for their model.\nIf violations of model conditions are still present, there was a reasonable attempt to address the violations based on the course content.\n\n### Results\n\nThis is where you will output the final model with any relevant model fit statistics.\n\nDescribe the key results from the model.\nThe goal is not to interpret every single variable in the model but rather to show that you are proficient in using the model output to address the research questions, using the interpretations to support your conclusions.\nFocus on the variables that help you answer the research question and that provide relevant context for the reader.\n\n#### Grading criteria\n\nThe model fit is clearly assessed, and interesting findings from the model are clearly described.\nInterpretations of model coefficients are used to support the key findings and conclusions, rather than merely listing the interpretation of every model coefficient.\nIf the primary modeling objective is prediction, the model's predictive power is thoroughly assessed.\n\n### Discussion + Conclusion\n\nIn this section you'll include a summary of what you have learned about your research question along with statistical arguments supporting your conclusions.\nIn addition, discuss the limitations of your analysis and provide suggestions on ways the analysis could be improved.\nAny potential issues pertaining to the reliability and validity of your data and appropriateness of the statistical analysis should also be discussed here.\nLastly, this section will include ideas for future work.\n\n#### Grading criteria\n\nOverall conclusions from analysis are clearly described, and the model results are put into the larger context of the subject matter and original research question.\nThere is thoughtful consideration of potential limitations of the data and/or analysis, and ideas for future work are clearly described.\n\n### Organization + formatting\n\nThis is an assessment of the overall presentation and formatting of the written report.\n\n#### Grading criteria\n\nThe report neatly written and organized with clear section headers and appropriately sized figures with informative labels.\nNumerical results are displayed with a reasonable number of digits, and all visualizations are neatly formatted.\nAll citations and links are properly formatted.\nIf there is an appendix, it is reasonably organized and easy for the reader to find relevant information.\nAll code, warnings, and messages are suppressed.\nThe main body of the written report (not including the appendix) is no longer than 10 pages.\n\n## Video presentation + slides\n\n### Slides\n\nIn addition to the written report, your team will also create presentation slides and record a video presentation that summarize and showcase your project.\nIntroduce your research question and data set, showcase visualizations, and discuss the primary conclusions.\nThese slides should serve as a brief visual addition to your written report and will be graded for content and quality.\n\n**For submission, convert these slides to a .pdf document, and submit the PDF of the slides on Gradescope.**\n\nThe slide deck should have no more than 6 content slides + 1 title slide.\nHere is a *suggested* outline as you think through the slides;

  If your presentation slides are online, you can put a link to the slides in a `README.md` file in the `presentation` folder.\n\nPoints for reproducibility + organization will be based on the reproducibility of the written report and the organization of the project GitHub repo.\nThe repo should be neatly organized as described above, there should be no extraneous files, all text in the README should be easily readable.\n\n## Peer teamwork evaluation\n\nYou will be asked to fill out a survey where you rate the contribution and teamwork of each team member by assigning a contribution percentage for each team member.\nFilling out the survey is a prerequisite for getting credit on the team member evaluation.\nIf you are suggesting that an individual did less than half the expected contribution given your team size (e.g., for a team of four students, if a student contributed less than 12.5% of the total effort), please provide some explanation.\nIf any individual gets an average peer score indicating that this was the case, their grade will be assessed accordingly.\n\nIf you have concerns with the teamwork and/or contribution from any team members, please email me by the project video deadline.\n**You only need to email me if you have concerns**.\nOtherwise, I will assume everyone on the team equally contributed and will receive full credit for the teamwork portion of the grade.\n\n## Overall grading\n\nThe grade breakdown is as follows:\n\n| Total                              | 100 pts |\n|------------------------------------|---------|\n| **Topic ideas**                    | 5 pts   |\n| **Project proposal**               | 10 pts  |\n| **Peer review**                    | 10 pts  |\n| **Written report**                 | 40 pts  |\n| **Slides + video presentation**    | 20 pts  |\n| **Reproducibility + organization** | 5 pts   |\n| **Video comments**                 | 5 pts   |\n| **Peer teamwork evaluation**       | 5 pts   |\n\n*Note: No late project reports or videos are accepted.*\n\n### Grading summary\n\nGrading of the project will take into account the following:\n\n-   Content - What is the quality of research and/or policy question and relevancy of data to those questions?\n-   Correctness - Are statistical procedures carried out and explained correctly?\n-   Writing and Presentation - What is the quality of the statistical presentation, writing, and explanations?\n-   Creativity and Critical Thought - Is the project carefully thought out? Are the limitations carefully considered? Does it appear that time and effort went into the planning and implementation of the project?\n\nA general breakdown of scoring is as follows:\n\n-   *90%-100%*: Outstanding effort. Student understands how to apply all statistical concepts, can put the results into a cogent argument, can identify weaknesses in the argument, and can clearly communicate the results to others.\n-   *80%-89%*: Good effort. Student understands most of the concepts, puts together an adequate argument, identifies some weaknesses of their argument, and communicates most results clearly to others.\n-   *70%-79%*: Passing effort. Student has misunderstanding of concepts in several areas, has some trouble putting results together in a cogent argument, and communication of results is sometimes unclear.\n-   *60%-69%*: Struggling effort. Student is making some effort, but has misunderstanding of many concepts and is unable to put together a cogent argument. Communication of results is unclear.\n-   *Below 60%*: Student is not making a sufficient effort.\n\n### Late work policy\n\n**There is no late work accepted on this project.** Be sure to turn in your work early to avoid any technological mishaps.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## Timeline\n\n[Topic ideas](#topic-ideas) due Fri, Feb 18\n\n[Proposal](#project-proposal) due Fri, Mar 18\n\n[Draft report](#draft-report) due Fri, Apr 8\n\n[Peer review](#peer-review) due Fri, Apr 15\n\n[Final report](#written-report) due Mon, Apr 25\n\n[Video presentation + slides](#video-presentation--slides) and [final GitHub repo](#reproducibility---organization) due Thu, Apr 28\n\n[Presentation comments](#presentation-comments) due Sat, Apr 30\n\n## Introduction\n\n**TL;DR**: *Pick a data set and do a regression analysis. That is your final project.*\n\nThe goal of the final project is for you to use regression analysis to analyze a data set of your own choosing.\nThe data set may already exist or you may collect your own data by scraping the web.\n\nChoose the data based on your group's interests or work you all have done in other courses or research projects.\nThe goal of this project is for you to demonstrate proficiency in the techniques we have covered in this class (and beyond, if you like!) and apply them to a data set to analyze it in a meaningful way.\n\nAll analyses must be done in RStudio, and all components of the project **must be reproducible** (with the exception of the presentation).\n\n### Logistics\n\nYou will work on the project with your lab groups.\n\nThe four primary deliverables for the final project are\n\n-   A written, reproducible report detailing your analysis\n-   A GitHub repository corresponding to your report\n-   Slides + a video presentation\n-   Formal peer review on another team's project\n\n## Topic ideas {#topic-ideas}\n\nIdentify 2-3 data sets you're interested in potentially using for the final project.\nIf you're unsure where to find data, you can use the list of potential data sources in the [Tips + Resources](#tips--resources) section as a starting point.\nIt may also help to think of topics you're interested in investigating and find data sets on those topics.\n\nThe purpose of submitting project ideas is to give you time to find data for the project and to make sure you have a data set that can help you be successful in the project.\n**Therefore, you must use one of the data sets submitted as a topic idea, unless otherwise notified by the teaching team.**\n\nThe data sets should meet the following criteria:\n\n-   At least 500 observations\n\n-   At least 10 columns\n\n-   At least 6 of the columns must be useful and unique predictor variables.\n\n    -   Identifier variables such as \"name\", \"social security number\", etc. are not useful predictor variables.\n    -   If you have multiple columns with the same information (e.g. \"state abbreviation\" and \"state name\"), then they are not unique predictors.\n\n-   At least one variable that can be identified as a reasonable response variable.\n\n    -   The response variable can be quantitative or categorical.\n\n-   A mix of quantitative and categorical variables that can be used as predictors.\n\n-   Observations should reasonably meet the independence condition.\n    Therefore, avoid data with repeated measures, data collected over time, etc.\n\n-   You may not use data that has previously been used in any course materials, or any derivation of data that has been used in course materials.\n\n**Please ask a member of the teaching team if you're unsure whether your data set meets the criteria.**\n\nFor each data set, include the following:\n\n#### Introduction and data\n\n-   State the source of the data set.\n-   Describe when and how it was originally collected (by the original data curator, not necessarily how you found the data)\n-   Describe the observations and the general characteristics being measured in the data\n\n#### Research question\n\n-   Describe a research question you're interested in answering using this data.\n\n#### Glimpse of data\n\n-   Use the `glimpse` function to provide an overview of each data set\n\nSubmit the PDF of the topic ideas to Gradescope.\nMark all pages associated with each data set.\n\n## Project proposal {#project-proposal}\n\nThe purpose of the project proposal is to help you think about your analysis strategy early.\n\nInclude the following in the proposal:\n\n### Section 1 - Introduction\n\nThe introduction section includes\n\n-   an introduction to the subject matter you're investigating\n-   the motivation for your research question (citing any relevant literature)\n-   the general research question you wish to explore\n-   your hypotheses regarding the research question of interest.\n\n### Section 2 - Data description\n\nIn this section, you will describe the data set you wish to explore.\nThis includes\n\n-   description of the observations in the data set,\n-   description of how the data was originally collected (not how you found the data but how the original curator of the data collected it).\n\n### Section 3 - Analysis approach\n\nIn this section, you will provide a brief overview of your analysis approach.\nThis includes:\n\n-   Description of the response variable.\n-   Visualization and summary statistics for the response variable.\n-   List of variables that will be considered as predictors\n-   Regression model technique (multiple linear regression and logistic regression)\n\n### Data dictionary (aka code book)\n\nSubmit a data dictionary for all the variables in your data set in the `README` of your project repo, in the `data` folder.\nLink to this file from your proposal writeup.\n\n### Submission\n\nPush all of your final changes to the GitHub repo, and submit the PDF of your proposal to Gradescope.\n\n### Proposal grading\n\n| Total                | 10 pts |\n|----------------------|--------|\n| **Introduction**     | 3 pts  |\n| **Data description** | 2 pts  |\n| **Analysis plan**    | 4 pts  |\n| **Data dictionary**  | 1 pts  |\n\nEach component will be graded as follows:\n\n-   **Meets expectations (full credit)**: All required elements are completed and are accurate.\n    The narrative is written clearly, all tables and visualizations are nicely formatted, and the work would be presentable in a professional setting.\n\n-   **Close to expectations (half credit)**: There are some elements missing and/or inaccurate.\n    There are some issues with formatting.\n\n-   **Does not meet expectations (no credit)**: Major elements missing.\n    Work is not neatly formatted and would not be presentable in a professional setting.\n\n## Draft report {#draft-report}\n\nThe purpose of the draft and peer review is to give you an opportunity to get early feedback on your analysis.\nTherefore, the draft and peer review will focus primarily on the exploratory data analysis, modeling, and initial interpretations.\n\nWrite the draft in the **written-report.qmd** file in your project repo.\nYou do not need to submit the draft on Gradescope.\n\nBelow is a brief description of the sections to focus on in the draft:\n\n### Introduction and data\n\nThis section includes an introduction to the project motivation, data, and research question.\nDescribe the data and definitions of key variables.\nIt should also include some exploratory data analysis.\nAll of the EDA won't fit in the paper, so focus on the EDA for the response variable and a few other interesting variables and relationships.\n\n### Methodology\n\nThis section includes a brief description of your modeling process.\nExplain the reasoning for the type of model you're fitting, predictor variables considered for the model including any interactions.\nAdditionally, show how you arrived at the final model by describing the model selection process, any variable transformations (if needed), and any other relevant considerations that were part of the model fitting process.\n\n### Results\n\nIn this section, you will output the final model and include a brief discussion of the model assumptions, diagnostics, and any relevant model fit statistics.\n\nThis section also includes initial interpretations and conclusions drawn from the model.\n\n## Peer review {#peer-review}\n\nCritically reviewing others' work is a crucial part of the scientific process, and STA 210 is no exception.\nEach lab team will be assigned two other teams's projects to review.\nEach team should push their draft to their GitHub repo by the due date.\nOne lab in the following week will be dedicated to the peer review, and all reviews will be due by the end of that lab session.\n\nDuring the peer review process, you will be provided read-only access to your partner teams' GitHub repos.\nProvide your review in the form of GitHub issues to your partner team's GitHub repo using the issue template provided.\nThe peer review will be graded on the extent to which it comprehensively and constructively addresses the components of the partner team's report: the research context and motivation, exploratory data analysis, modeling, interpretations, and conclusions.\n\n### Pairings\n\n#### Section 1 -

however, grading will largely be based on the content in the main body of the report.\nYou should assume the reader will not see the material in the appendix unless prompted to view it in the main body of the report.\nThe appendix should be neatly formatted and easy for the reader to navigate.\nIt is not included in the 10-page limit.\n\nThe written report is worth 40 points, broken down as follows\n\n| Total                         | 40 pts |\n|-------------------------------|--------|\n| **Introduction/data**         | 6 pts  |\n| **Methodology**               | 10 pts |\n| **Results**                   | 14 pts |\n| **Discussion + conclusion**   | 6 pts  |\n| **Organization + formatting** | 4 pts  |\n\n[Click here](/documents/project-report-rubric.pdf \"Project rubric\") for a PDF of the written report rubric.\n\n### Introduction and data\n\nThis section includes an introduction to the project motivation, data, and research question.\nDescribe the data and definitions of key variables.\nIt should also include some exploratory data analysis.\nAll of the EDA won't fit in the paper, so focus on the EDA for the response variable and a few other interesting variables and relationships.\n\n#### Grading criteria\n\nThe research question and motivation are clearly stated in the introduction, including citations for the data source and any external research.\nThe data are clearly described, including a description about how the data were originally collected and a concise definition of the variables relevant to understanding the report.\nThe data cleaning process is clearly described, including any decisions made in the process (e.g., creating new variables, removing observations, etc.) The explanatory data analysis helps the reader better understand the observations in the data along with interesting and relevant relationships between the variables.\nIt incorporates appropriate visualizations and summary statistics.\n\n### Methodology\n\nThis section includes a brief description of your modeling process.\nExplain the reasoning for the type of model you're fitting, predictor variables considered for the model including any interactions.\nAdditionally, show how you arrived at the final model by describing the model selection process, interactions considered, variable transformations (if needed), assessment of conditions and diagnostics, and any other relevant considerations that were part of the model fitting process.\n\n#### Grading criteria\n\nThe analysis steps are appropriate for the data and research question.\nThe group used a thorough and careful approach to select the final model; the approach is clearly described in the report.\nThe model selection process took into account potential interaction effects and addressed any violations in model conditions.\nThe model conditions and diagnostics are thoroughly and accurately assessed for their model.\nIf violations of model conditions are still present, there was a reasonable attempt to address the violations based on the course content.\n\n### Results\n\nThis is where you will output the final model with any relevant model fit statistics.\n\nDescribe the key results from the model.\nThe goal is not to interpret every single variable in the model but rather to show that you are proficient in using the model output to address the research questions, using the interpretations to support your conclusions.\nFocus on the variables that help you answer the research question and that provide relevant context for the reader.\n\n#### Grading criteria\n\nThe model fit is clearly assessed, and interesting findings from the model are clearly described.\nInterpretations of model coefficients are used to support the key findings and conclusions, rather than merely listing the interpretation of every model coefficient.\nIf the primary modeling objective is prediction, the model's predictive power is thoroughly assessed.\n\n### Discussion + Conclusion\n\nIn this section you'll include a summary of what you have learned about your research question along with statistical arguments supporting your conclusions.\nIn addition, discuss the limitations of your analysis and provide suggestions on ways the analysis could be improved.\nAny potential issues pertaining to the reliability and validity of your data and appropriateness of the statistical analysis should also be discussed here.\nLastly, this section will include ideas for future work.\n\n#### Grading criteria\n\nOverall conclusions from analysis are clearly described, and the model results are put into the larger context of the subject matter and original research question.\nThere is thoughtful consideration of potential limitations of the data and/or analysis, and ideas for future work are clearly described.\n\n### Organization + formatting\n\nThis is an assessment of the overall presentation and formatting of the written report.\n\n#### Grading criteria\n\nThe report neatly written and organized with clear section headers and appropriately sized figures with informative labels.\nNumerical results are displayed with a reasonable number of digits, and all visualizations are neatly formatted.\nAll citations and links are properly formatted.\nIf there is an appendix, it is reasonably organized and easy for the reader to find relevant information.\nAll code, warnings, and messages are suppressed.\nThe main body of the written report (not including the appendix) is no longer than 10 pages.\n\n## Video presentation + slides\n\n### Slides\n\nIn addition to the written report, your team will also create presentation slides and record a video presentation that summarize and showcase your project.\nIntroduce your research question and data set, showcase visualizations, and discuss the primary conclusions.\nThese slides should serve as a brief visual addition to your written report and will be graded for content and quality.\n\n**For submission, convert these slides to a .pdf document, and submit the PDF of the slides on Gradescope.**\n\nThe slide deck should have no more than 6 content slides + 1 title slide.\nHere is a *suggested* outline as you think through the slides; you [**do not**]{.underline} have to use this exact format for the 6 slides.\n\n-   Title Slide\n-   Slide 1: Introduce the topic and motivation\n-   Slide 2: Introduce the data\n-   Slide 3: Highlights from EDA\n-   Slide 4: Final model\n-   Slide 5: Interesting findings from the model\n-   Slide 6: Conclusions + future work\n\n### Video presentation\n\nFor the video presentation, you can speak over your slide deck, similar to the lecture content videos.\n**The video presentation must be no longer than 8 minutes.** It is fine if the video is shorter than 8 minutes, but it cannot exceed 8 minutes.\nYou may use can use any platform that works best for your group to record your presentation.\nBelow are a few resources on recording videos:\n\n-   [Recording presentations in Zoom](https://kb.siue.edu/61721)\n-   [Apple Quicktime for screen recording](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/quicktime-player/qtp97b08e666/mac)\n-   [Windows 10 built-in screen recording functionality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfPbr1mRDuo)\n-   [Kap for screen recording](https://getkap.co/)\n\nOnce your video is ready, upload the video to Warpwire, then embed the video in an new discussion post on Conversations.\n\n#### To upload your video to Warpwire:\n\n-   Click the Warpwire tab in the course Sakai site.\n-   Click the \"+\" and select \"Upload files\".\n-   Locate the video on your computer and click to upload.\n-   Once you've uploaded the video to Warpwire, click to share the video and copy the video's URL. You will need this when you post the video in the discussion forum.\n\n#### To post the video to the discussion forum\n\n-   Click the Presentations tab in the course Sakai site.\n-   Click the Presentations topic.\n-   Click \"Start a new conversation\".\n-   Make the title \"Your Team Name: Project Title\".

  If your presentation slides are online, you can put a link to the slides in a `README.md` file in the `presentation` folder.\n\nPoints for reproducibility + organization will be based on the reproducibility of the written report and the organization of the project GitHub repo.\nThe repo should be neatly organized as described above, there should be no extraneous files, all text in the README should be easily readable.\n\n## Peer teamwork evaluation\n\nYou will be asked to fill out a survey where you rate the contribution and teamwork of each team member by assigning a contribution percentage for each team member.\nFilling out the survey is a prerequisite for getting credit on the team member evaluation.\nIf you are suggesting that an individual did less than half the expected contribution given your team size (e.g., for a team of four students, if a student contributed less than 12.5% of the total effort), please provide some explanation.\nIf any individual gets an average peer score indicating that this was the case, their grade will be assessed accordingly.\n\nIf you have concerns with the teamwork and/or contribution from any team members, please email me by the project video deadline.\n**You only need to email me if you have concerns**.\nOtherwise, I will assume everyone on the team equally contributed and will receive full credit for the teamwork portion of the grade.\n\n## Overall grading\n\nThe grade breakdown is as follows:\n\n| Total                              | 100 pts |\n|------------------------------------|---------|\n| **Topic ideas**                    | 5 pts   |\n| **Project proposal**               | 10 pts  |\n| **Peer review**                    | 10 pts  |\n| **Written report**                 | 40 pts  |\n| **Slides + video presentation**    | 20 pts  |\n| **Reproducibility + organization** | 5 pts   |\n| **Video comments**                 | 5 pts   |\n| **Peer teamwork evaluation**       | 5 pts   |\n\n*Note: No late project reports or videos are accepted.*\n\n### Grading summary\n\nGrading of the project will take into account the following:\n\n-   Content - What is the quality of research and/or policy question and relevancy of data to those questions?\n-   Correctness - Are statistical procedures carried out and explained correctly?\n-   Writing and Presentation - What is the quality of the statistical presentation, writing, and explanations?\n-   Creativity and Critical Thought - Is the project carefully thought out? Are the limitations carefully considered? Does it appear that time and effort went into the planning and implementation of the project?\n\nA general breakdown of scoring is as follows:\n\n-   *90%-100%*: Outstanding effort. Student understands how to apply all statistical concepts, can put the results into a cogent argument, can identify weaknesses in the argument, and can clearly communicate the results to others.\n-   *80%-89%*: Good effort. Student understands most of the concepts, puts together an adequate argument, identifies some weaknesses of their argument, and communicates most results clearly to others.\n-   *70%-79%*: Passing effort. Student has misunderstanding of concepts in several areas, has some trouble putting results together in a cogent argument, and communication of results is sometimes unclear.\n-   *60%-69%*: Struggling effort. Student is making some effort, but has misunderstanding of many concepts and is unable to put together a cogent argument. Communication of results is unclear.\n-   *Below 60%*: Student is not making a sufficient effort.\n\n### Late work policy\n\n**There is no late work accepted on this project.** Be sure to turn in your work early to avoid any technological mishaps.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"wrap","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true,"format-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"output-file":"portfolio.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table

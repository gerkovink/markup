    "text": "1.1 Introduction\nDear all,\nWelcome to MLaRPiS. In this course you will learn a great deal about presenting and structuring your research. We start doing so with \\(\\LaTeX\\), an environment for typesetting documents that is particularly useful for complex content, such as graphics, tables and equations. The result of a LaTeX document is a perfectly typeset pdf that adheres to a set of predefined rules. Many journals and preprint services in our field require LaTeX documents. This is why you have to learn it. The resulting flexibility and customizability when using LaTeX is why you should learn it.\nI will take you through the basics of the scientific LaTeX family in a couple of walkthroughs and optional exercises. In these exercises we will treat:\nMastering a new scripting or programming environment is not done by simple exercises, but requires practice and repetition. Don’t worry, the documents you will have to produce during this course will require you to repeat the LaTeX process (Wk1) and the processes and skills in other weeks over and over. However, you should work together with others and share your insights, findings and documents. We’ll cover those bases in other weeks.\nOf course you will run into problems and/or difficulties. In general: the internet is your friend. Chances are that someone else encountered the same issue and, most likely, a solution has been posed by an expert user. If, however, you seem stuck; please post an issue on GitHub. Collectively, we can then troubleshoot your problem and help you reach a solution. Just remember that outside of class hours, answers may take a bit longer.\nLaTeX is extremely flexible and allows you to typeset documents with ‘surgical precision’. There are however languages that allow you to create basic documents much quicker, but without the level of detail that LaTeX offers. One such a language is Markdown. This document is created with quarto, an implementation that goes far beyond Markdown and can be compiled from within RStudio. Of course it is required that you learn LaTeX, but since Markdown and Quarto allow for direct integration of LaTeX and Html5, it can be a very valuable tool. If you’d like to see the Quarto files (.qmd), feel free to browse around the course materials repository at github.com/gerkovink/markup.\nEnough general intro. Let’s start,\nGerko and Hanne",

    "text": "1.2 The TeX framework\nTeX’s structure bares close resemblance to that of the R-project. The core functionality can easily be expanded by users by means of packages. These packages are stored in a centralized location called the Comprehensive TeX Archive Network (CTAN). The TexLive and MacTex distributions contain an image of many of the available packages, meaning that you will have most functionality available at all times (even offline).\nJust like with R, TeX is a software implementation that requires an editor to work with. LaTeX is a set of macros that make TeX easier for the users. From this moment on, if I speak about TeX, I am most likely refering to LaTeX.\nTeX is widely used by publishers as it give the user full control about the appearance of the document. It is designed to write in such a way that a minimum of attention is required by the user to typeset the document (as opposed to e.g. typesetting hell MS Word).\n\n\n1.2.1 Installing a TeX framework\nIf you are on Windows or Linux, I suggest you install the easy to install ProTeXt distribution or the TexLive distribution. If you are on a Mac, the MacTex distribution will give you everything you need. If you use the default installation parameters, everything you might ever need is included in these distributions. Both distributions come with an excellent (but basic) editor (Texworks in Texlive and TexShop in MacTex), but if you want to go the fancy way: there are very good alternatives. See this page for a comprehensive overview of all TeX editors and code editors with TeX capabilities.\nAlternatively, you can use the online TeX editor Overleaf. Please pay attention to any data privacy regulations. It may not be an option for all your research endeavors.",

    "section": "1.3 The structure of a LaTeX document",
    "text": "1.3 The structure of a LaTeX document\nOpen the file LaTeX_template.tex from the course page. This file is a template that you may use for your documents in this course. The file LaTeX_template.pdf is the typeset version of this document (the output result). We will go through the document line-by-line:\n\n    \\documentclass[10pt, fullpage, a4paper, titlepage]{article}\n\nThis is the line that tells TeX what the class of the document is and how it should be interpreted dimension-wise. In this situation, we use a 10 point font size (options are 10, 11 and 12 point), use the full page, use A4 paper size (as opposed to e.g. US letter format) and require a titlepage. The class of the document is set to be article. There are many deviations from the defaults. A simple online search usually gets you the option you desire.\n\n    \\usepackage{graphicx, latexsym}\n    \\usepackage{setspace}\n    \\usepackage{apalike}\n    \\usepackage{amssymb, amsmath, amsthm}\n    \\usepackage{bm}\n    \\usepackage{epstopdf}\n    \\usepackage[]{hyperref}\n\nWe load these packages by default, because they sum up pretty much everything needed to begin working with LaTeX as a statistician. They govern devices such as graphics, mathematical notation (normal and bold face), and so on. Package hyperref is particularly interesting, because it allows you to set the meta-info for your document and it allows you to specify the way links and references in your document are treated. Meta-info is needed to make your documents indexable and, hence, more visible to you and everyone on the internet (if your document is on the internet).\n\n    \\hypersetup{\n    pdftitle={title of the pdf},\n    pdfauthor={your name},\n    pdfsubject={cool stuff},\n    pdfkeywords={koala, chuck norris},\n    bookmarksnumbered=true,     \n    bookmarksopen=true,         \n    bookmarksopenlevel=1,       \n    colorlinks=true,            \n    pdfstartview=Fit,           \n    pdfpagemode=UseOutlines,      \n    pdfpagelayout=TwoPageRight\n    }\n\nThese are the options set for package hyperref. You can specify the document and author information and add keywords. The other options are also relevant, but we will not discuss them now.\n\n    %\\singlespacing\n    %\\onehalfspacing\n    \\doublespacing\n\nIf you like to have a single-spaced document (commented out by %, so not executed), a one-and-a-half-spaced document (commented out by %, so also not executed) or a double-spaced document (not commented out by %, so executed), these options from package setspace are very handy.\n\n    \\title{title of your paper\\\\ \\small subtitle of your paper}\n    \\author{name}\n    %\\date{\\today}\n    \\date{}\n\nGive titlepage information. We have set a title and a smaller subtitle. A line-break in tex is denoted by \\\\, although most of the times you won’t need to use this as tex takes care of this for you in most situations. The \\small command tells tex that the remainder of this textbox is to be printed in a smaller font. All functions in tex are preceded by \\. So, \\author{} is the function for author, \\date{} the function for the date and \\today the function that prints todays date.\nUp until now, we have not done anything. No code is executed. We have just been considering the preamble of a tex document. To start a document, we use \\begin{document}.\n\n    \\begin{document}\n\nWe can then tell tex to print the titlepage information that we assigned (title, author, date)\n\n    \\maketitle\n\nand continue the document on a new page:\n\n    \\newpage\n\nWe start the first section, labelled abstract:\n\n    \\section*{Abstract}\n    text of abstract\n\nThen a section called Introduction:\n\n    \\section{Introduction}\n    text introduction\n\nWith a subsection called sub introduction:\n\n    \\subsection{sub introduction}\n    text text text\n\nAnd we end the document by the \\end{} command.\n\n    \\end{document}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise on TeX classes - optional\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this optional exercise you can make yourself familiar with some of the TeX classes. A class is a clear definition of the type of document. There are classes for books, articles, letters, resumes, and so on. There are even classes for journals and bookseries by publishers, such as Springer, Elsevier, CRC and Sage.\nClasses are usually linked to style files, the files that define the looks of a document. Have a look at the LaTeX background archive if you’d like to know more about how classes and styles make documents look different. It is important to realize that not every document by default accommodates for the type of content. Some classes make some content look ridiculous. Imagine printing an A5 document on an A1 canvas, or submitting a job application as a statistical journal manuscript. Choosing a proper class is therefore essential. The good thing with LaTeX is that different classes can easily be applied to the same content.\n\n\n1.3.1 Exercise\nUse the text in the Virgil - Aeneid.txt file as the content for the following five documents:\n\nAn article with 12 point font size on US letter paper.\nA book with 10 point font size on A4 paper.\nA book with 10 point font size on A5 paper.\nA minimal document with 12 point font size on A5 paper.\nA letter with 12 point font size on A5 paper.\n\nYou just need to specify the paragraphs correctly.

This week we’ll bite the bullet by learning about two massively important tools for your toolset: version controlling and simulation.\nTo document our activity and our changes in detail, we’ll use Git. You can view Git as the ability to go back in time. Back to the very beginning of your project. A bonus: Git integrates nicely with RStudio. In this series of exercises we will learn\n\nHow to integrate Git within our projects.\nHow to publish our projects as GitHub repositories\nHow to go about development with Git and GitHub\nHow to solve scenarios where Git hits the fan.\n\nAnd in the meanwhile we’ll also Monte Carlo simulate one of the most important concepts in statistics:\n\nConfidence Validity\n\nUse the appropriate channels to ask questions and hand-in your work.\nAll the best,\nGerko and Hanne",

    "text": "3.4 Git and GitHub\n\n3.4.1 Git\nGit is a free and open source version control system for text files. It can handle extensive change logging for you, no matter the size of the project. Git is fast and efficient, but its effectiveness depends also on the frequency you instruct it to log your project’s changes.\nYou can see Git as a blank canvas that starts at a certain point in time. Every time you (or others) instruct Git to log any changes that have been made, Git adds the changes that are made to this canvas. We call the changes to the canvas commits. With every commit an extensive log is created that includes at least the following information:\n\nthe changes made\nwho made the changes\nmetadata\na small piece of text that describe the changes made\n\nThe difference between two commits - or the changes between them - are called diffs.\nIf you’d like to know much more about Git, this online book is a very good resource. If you’d like to practice with the command line interface use this webpage for a quick course. This book covers pretty much everything you need to marry Git and R.\n\n\n\n3.4.2 GitHub\nGitHub is the social and user interface to Git that allows you to work in repositories. These repositories can be seen as project folders in which you publish your work, but you can also use them as test sites for development, testing, etcetera. There is a distinction between private repositories (only for you and those you grant access) and public repositories (visible for everyone).\nYour public repositories can be viewed and forked by everyone. Forking is when other people create a copy of your repository on their own account. This allows them to work on a repository without affecting the master. You can also do this yourself, but then the process is called branching instead of forking. If you create a copy of a repository that is offline, the process is called cloning.\nGitHub’s ability to branch, fork and clone is very useful as it allows other people and yourself to experiment on (the code in) a repository before any definitive changes are merged with the master. If you’re working in a forked repository, you can submit a pull request to the repository collaborators to accept (or reject) any suggested changes.\nFor now, this may be confusing, but I hope you recognize the benefits GitHub can have on the process of development and bug-fixing. For example, the most up-to-date version of the mice package in R can be directly installed from the mice repository with the following code:\n\ninstall.packages(\"devtools\")\ndevtools::install_github(repo = \"stefvanbuuren/mice\")\n\nYou can see that this process requires package devtools that expands the R functionality with essential development tools. Loading packages in R directly from their respective GitHub repositories, allows you to obtain the latest - often improved and less buggy - iteration of that software even before it is published on CRAN.\n\n\n\n3.4.3 Installing Git\n\n3.4.3.1 Installing on Mac\nI suggest you install Git by downloading and installing GitHub Desktop. GitHub’s desktop application is a nice GUI and, naturally, integrates well into the repository workflow on GitHub.\nWhen installed, you can go to GitHub Desktop &gt; Install Command Line Tool\nAfter a reboot, all should be set.\n\n\n3.4.3.2 Installing on Windows\nDownload and install Git for Windows, Then download and install GitHub Desktop. GitHub’s desktop application is a nice GUI and, naturally, integrates well into the repository workflow on GitHub.\nAfter a reboot, all should be set.\n\n\n\n\n3.4.4 Command line interface vs. GUI\nUltimately, you’ll want to learn how to use Git through the command line interface (CLI). It offers better and more comprehensive functionality. Again, take this 15-minute course to get a gentle introduction. But do not be afraid that you miss out on the CLI if you don’t study this link: In week 4 we’ll explore in detail how to handle Git when things go haywire. You’ll be a CLI-wizard by then.\n\n\n\n3.4.5 .gitignore\nGitHub sees every file in your repository as one of the following three\n\ntracked files that have been (previously) staged and committed\nuntracked files that have not been staged or committed\nignored files that have been explicitly ignored\n\nIt may be wise to instruct Git to ignore changes in some files. For example, compiled files (think about .com, .exe, .o, .so, etc), archives (e.g. .zip, .tar, .rar), logs (.log) and files generated in runtime (.temp) do not have to be tracked by Git. The same holds for hidden system files (e.g. .DS_Store or Thumbs.db). Adding such filetypes to a file named .gitignore and placing that file in the root of your repository will take care of focusing Git’s energy on useful files only. For common .gitignore examples, see this repository. There are many examples inside, such as this .gitignore example for R\n\n\n\n3.4.6 Linking GitHub and RStudio\nSecurely linking your local machine to the remote repository is vital when collaborating with other people. In short; you would not want a potential hacker to have contributor access to any of your projects. I have prepared this walkthrough video that details the process of linking GitHub to your machine and RStudio. Below I explain the rationale of using both an SSH key and a personal access token.\nIf you still experience problems after following my walkthrough, check this chapter\nTo learn more about maintaining a package as GitHub repository within RStudio, have a look at this guide by Hadley Wickham.\n\n\n\n3.4.7 SSH keys\nWith an SSH key you can identify yourself to an online server (in this case the GitHub server) without having to log in every time. It is like your machine having access to an online server through a unique biometric security measure, but instead of biometric data a bits-and-bytes hash code is communicated every time. You can use an SSH key to link RStudio to your GitHub repository, but it is better to use a personal access token for this. See below.\n\n\n\n3.4.8 Personal access tokens\nIf you use GitHub’s 2FA functionality - you should! - your username and password are not sufficient to push commits to GitHub through RStudio. To solve this follow these steps on github.com like I detail in this walkthrough video:\n\nLog in to your account\nClick on your profile photo (upper right corner) and select Settings\nGo to Developer settings\nSelect Personal access tokens in the left sidebar. The classic token as it is now called is sufficient\nClick Generate new token\nGive the token a name\nSelect at least the repo scope; you’ll need these permissions to access repositories. Also choose a relevant expiration: the longer the better, the shorter the safer. Remember that you can always generate a new token if you need to.\nClick Generate token\n\nCopy the token. The token will not be displayed again, so copy-paste it directly where it is needed. Remember that you can always generate a new token if you need to.\nIn RStudio, paste the generated token in the password field when RStudio asks for your credentials. The token will now serve as the unique authenticated link instead of your password.",

A full and comprehensive overview can be found in the pro Git book.\nO, and we forgot to tell you: you’ll need the terminal for this exercise. You may use the one in RStudio, or the dedicated terminal on UNIX systems or the command prompt or Windows Terminal on Windows.\n\n\n\n3.6.2 Prepare\nBefore we continue it is good to all start from the point of departure.\n\nUse the terminal to navigate to the Git repository (the location of the git repo on your HDD)\nType git pull to make sure that you obtain the latest state from the remote on GitHub\n\n\n% git pull\nAlready up to date.\n\nDon’t type the %; that is just the command prompt indicator on my machine.

It is up to date with origin/Exercise_wk4, meaning that GitHub and my local copy are in sync. origin is a shorthand name for the remote repository that a project was originally cloned from. It is useful that origin is referenced instead of the original repo’s URL –&gt; This makes referencing much more convenient.\n\n\n\n3.6.3 Inspect the current state\nMake sure you are in the Exercise_wk4 branch.

You can also see that I updated the .gitignore, a hidden file that specifies which files and directories to be ignored by Git. And I did some cosmetic changes and file deletions. This is very insightfull because of the detailed, but consice commit messages.\n\n\n\n3.6.4 Checkout an old state\nGo back in time to 21a3b5ac1535703f4ce0d6feb2ccf3703f95eee3 Merge pull request #2 from gerkovink/gerkodev.\nTo do so, we only need to refer the start of the SHA-1 key.\n\n% git checkout 21a3b5a\nNote: switching to '21a3b5a'.\n\nYou are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental\nchanges and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this\nstate without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.\n\nIf you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may\ndo so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:\n\n  git switch -c &lt;new-branch-name&gt;\n\nOr undo this operation with:\n\n  git switch -\n\nTurn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false\n\nHEAD is now at 21a3b5a Merge pull request #2 from gerkovink/gerkodev\n\nWe are now at the old state. So we went back in time. The current state where we are is independent from all later commits, but is built exactly on all preceding commits as per the tree.\nThere are a couple of terms that are new:\n\nHEAD: The HEAD in Git is the pointer to the current branch reference. It is the last commit you have made or checked out [in our case]. REMEMBER that the head will always serve as the parent to the next commit\ndetached HEAD: The same as the head, but now the pointer references a specific commit and not a branch.\n\n\n\n3.6.4.1 The problem with a detached HEAD\nThis webpage illustrates the dangers of committing changes under a detached head quite nicely:\n\nThe HEAD pointer in Git determines your current working revision (and thereby the files that are placed in your project’s working directory). Normally, when checking out a proper branch name, Git automatically moves the HEAD pointer along when you create a new commit. You are automatically on the newest commit of the chosen branch.  When you instead choose to check out a commit hash, Git won’t do this for you. The consequence is that when you make changes and commit them, these changes do NOT belong to any branch. This means they can easily get lost once you check out a different revision or branch: not being recorded in the context of a branch, you lack the possibility to access that state easily (unless you have a brilliant memory and can remember the commit hash of that new commit…).\n\nThe useful thing about going to an old commit is that you can take this state as a point of departure. Just beware of the pitfalls of working under a detached HEAD.\n\n\n\n3.6.4.2 leave the detached HEAD\nGo back to the branch HEAD\n\n% git switch -                    \nPrevious HEAD position was 21a3b5a Merge pull request #2 from gerkovink/gerkodev\nSwitched to branch 'Exercise_wk4'\nYour branch is up to date with 'origin/Exercise_wk4'.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.6.5 Make a new branch of the old state\nLet’s take that old state and make it into a proper point of departure for new things. Again, reference 21a3b5ac1535703f4ce0d6feb2ccf3703f95eee3 Merge pull request #2 from gerkovink/gerkodev, but now we make the state of 21a3b5a into a new branch. We call that branch Wk4_markup:\n\n% git checkout -b Wk4_markup 21a3b5a \nSwitched to a new branch 'Wk4_markup'\n\nWe now have checked out an old state and made it into a new branch. The cool thing is that we can now commit all we want and everything will be properly logged. Just remember that if you’d like to go back in time and play around with an old state of your project –&gt; Merge the old state into a new branch like I demonstrated above.\n\n\n\n3.6.6 Add a new commit\nWe start by creating an empty text file\n\n% touch add_text_file.txt\n\nIf the touch command does not work on your machine, you may also create this file by hand. In a Windows-terminal, you can also use the command:\n\nPS C:\\GitHub\\Markup2020&gt; New-Item .\\add_text_file.txt -type file\n\nNow, if we would like to commit the addition of this file to our repo, we get the following:\n\n% git commit -a -m 'add text file'\nOn branch Wk4_markup\nUntracked files:\n    add_text_file.txt\n\nnothing added to commit but untracked files present\n\nThe commit was not succesfull, because the file add_text_file.txt is not yet tracked. Note that I use -a to specify to commit all changed files and folders that are tracked. I use -m to indicate that I would like to add the message add text file.\nYou see that using a GUI to Git like GitHub desktop or RStudio is quite convenient if you would not like to indicate which files to track. It is also less flexible.\n\n\n3.6.6.1 Add files to tracking\nTo track all untracked files and folders\n\ngit add -A\n\n\n\n\n3.6.6.2 commit with a message\nNow if we revisit the commit command\n\n% git commit -a -m 'add text file'\n[Wk4_markup 8d30c46] add text file\n 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)\n create mode 100644 add_text_file.txt\n\n\n\n\n\n3.6.7 Study the log again\n\n% git log --pretty=oneline\n8d30c4698b9761d650de2f5288389257762753ce (HEAD -&gt; Wk4_markup) add text file\n21a3b5ac1535703f4ce0d6feb2ccf3703f95eee3 (old-state) Merge pull request #2 from gerkovink/gerkodev\nf4a11cbed729bc8454c01866aab4291b3b580d6f resize image\n7f0806b68387d4f3c8af5c1f27d94b69e90a2d13 Merge pull request #1 from gerkovink/gerkodev\na36ed81b3831e6084c2adf661dc4cfb32c4cb5f7 add childhood memory\n9ba9c43437a7f00f5095df55db0c07d7233ad152 Add CV\n9bf1c32ea55b60bce613d65765c18deb522772ff Update .gitignore\n18761716665262f19296fb5d8e7c1720c8cea58a Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/gerkovink/markup2020\n1ee60aa26142b5f175928d409614b8de84c1ef79 Update .gitignore\n7c3d816264b5629e7bfe112954178648d94a37b4 Delete markup_sticker_SMALL.psd\n37c356ca51b4ed03e96570934f28caf5fcfd75d8 Delete .DS_Store\nd56dd90172d1106117d53102e5053165bc182020 Update .gitignore\ne7b78b592a8000d3a647de3a265c69496adebfe5 Update .gitignore\nfdd923ad2b522d6e4357229ea801d23ec5b16717 update readme\n7e14559d7f7e8676d557c9b73fc43fb3a66a0c3c added sticker\n493609efa7ce659ebebf5a0d0300f23788397e68 Initial commit\n\nWe can see that the HEAD is now at the latest commit and that this commit comes after the old-state from which we created the branch.\n\n\n3.6.7.1 Now add another empty text file.\n\n% touch add_another_text_file.txt\n\nLet’s say that we rather would have included this file in the previous commit, we can achieve this by\n\n% git add -A\n% git commit --amend -m \"add two text files\"\n[Wk4_markup 9e6c38c] add two text files\n Date: Tue Nov 3 23:09:11 2020 +0100\n 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)\n create mode 100644 add_text_file.txt\n\nWe have effectively ammended the previous commit.

For example, the following command reverts all changes to the inital commit\n\n% git reset --hard 493609e  \nHEAD is now at 493609e Initial commit\n\nWe are now back at the first commit in the project.\n\n\n3.6.9 Undo undoing a commit\nTo properly do this without making mistakes, it is best to study the history of the HEAD\n\n% git reflog                \n493609e (HEAD -&gt; Wk4_markup) HEAD@{0}: reset: moving to 493609e\n9e6c38c HEAD@{1}: commit (amend): add two text files\n8d30c46 HEAD@{2}: commit: add text file\n21a3b5a (old-state) HEAD@{3}: checkout: moving from Exercise_wk4 to Wk4_markup\n176137b (origin/master, origin/HEAD, origin/Exercise_wk4, master, Exercise_wk4) HEAD@{4}: checkout: moving from Exercise_wk4 to Exercise_wk4\n176137b (origin/master, origin/HEAD, origin/Exercise_wk4, master, Exercise_wk4) HEAD@{5}: checkout: moving from old-state to Exercise_wk4\n21a3b5a (old-state) HEAD@{6}: checkout: moving from Exercise_wk4 to old-state\n176137b (origin/master, origin/HEAD, origin/Exercise_wk4, master, Exercise_wk4) HEAD@{7}: checkout: moving from 21a3b5ac1535703f4ce0d6feb2ccf3703f95eee3 to Exercise_wk4\n21a3b5a (old-state) HEAD@{8}: checkout: moving from Exercise_wk4 to 21a3b5a\n176137b (origin/master, origin/HEAD, origin/Exercise_wk4, master, Exercise_wk4) HEAD@{9}: checkout: moving from 21a3b5ac1535703f4ce0d6feb2ccf3703f95eee3 to Exercise_wk4\n21a3b5a (old-state) HEAD@{10}: checkout: moving from Exercise_wk4 to 21a3b\n176137b (origin/master, origin/HEAD, origin/Exercise_wk4, master, Exercise_wk4) HEAD@{11}: checkout: moving from 21a3b5ac1535703f4ce0d6feb2ccf3703f95eee3 to Exercise_wk4\n21a3b5a (old-state) HEAD@{12}: checkout: moving from Exercise_wk4 to 21a3b5a\n176137b (origin/master, origin/HEAD, origin/Exercise_wk4, master, Exercise_wk4) HEAD@{13}: checkout: moving from master to Exercise_wk4\n176137b (origin/master, origin/HEAD, origin/Exercise_wk4, master, Exercise_wk4) HEAD@{14}: checkout: moving from Exercise_wk4 to master\n176137b (origin/master, origin/HEAD, origin/Exercise_wk4, master, Exercise_wk4) HEAD@{15}: checkout: moving from Exercise_wk4 to Exercise_wk4\n176137b (origin/master, origin/HEAD, origin/Exercise_wk4, master, Exercise_wk4) HEAD@{16}: checkout: moving from master to Exercise_wk4\n176137b (origin/master, origin/HEAD, origin/Exercise_wk4, master, Exercise_wk4) HEAD@{17}: checkout: moving from SofieIssue to master\n1f488c6 (SofieIssue) HEAD@{18}: commit: remove pipe operator\n4ead406 HEAD@{19}: commit: update readme.md\n\nWe are now looking at the reflog - the log of where the HEAD has been. It used to be at\n\n9e6c38c HEAD@{1}: commit (amend): add two text files\n\nbut is now at\n\n493609e (HEAD -&gt; Wk4_markup) HEAD@{0}: reset: moving to 493609e\n\nWe can use this history of where the head has been to go back to the previous step. In other words, if we would like to undo a commit, we can always go back to the previous HEAD stage –&gt; the HEAD has been moved one step forward by the commit. Likewise, if we would like to undo a hard reset, we can also go back to the previous HEAD stage –&gt; the HEAD has been moved one step forward by the reset.\nTo undo it all, we can use the indicator that is referenced by the reflog:\n\n% git reset --hard HEAD@{1}\nHEAD is now at 9e6c38c add two text files\n\nUsing reflog and HEAD is in this case more flexible than using log and the SHA-1 hash. reflog yields the log of all changes in the pointer HEAD, while log only gives you the history of the logged commits. Once a commit is undone, it is gone from the log. Moreover, using reflog and HEAD allows you to go back into the future, like in the above example.\nNOTE: Do not wait too long to undo your resets. After a few days/weeks garbage collection may kick in and Git will eventually see old commit as unreferenced. This makes them irretrievable\n\n\n\n3.6.10 Redo a commit\nA hard reset brings you back to a previous state. It loses all changes that have been committed since. If you’d like to undo a single commit and erase the commit message, but not throw out the modifications:\n\ngit reset --soft 493609e \n\nWe are now back at the initial commit, but all changes since have been staged. We can commit these changes as\n\n% git commit -a -m 'everything in a single commit'\n[Wk4_markup 525efa5] everything in a single commit\n 7 files changed, 36 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)\n create mode 100644 Gerko/Assignment 1/Vink.jpg\n create mode 100644 Gerko/Assignment 1/Vink.pdf\n create mode 100644 README.Rmd\n create mode 100644 add_text_file.txt\n create mode 100644 markup_sticker_SMALL.png\n\nIf we study the log, we find that there are now only two commits.\n\n% git log --pretty=oneline                        \n5fe2c1bd44b1dbc92172b85dec3d87ced7073deb (HEAD -&gt; Wk4_markup) everything in a single commit\n493609efa7ce659ebebf5a0d0300f23788397e68 Initial commit\n\n\n\n\n3.6.11 Merging branches\nLet’s see if we can merge the Wk4_markup branch into the Exercise_wk4 branch.\nFirst we need to checkout the branch we would like to merge into:\n\n% git checkout Exercise_wk4\nUpdating files: 100% (174/174), done.\nSwitched to branch 'Exercise_wk4'\nYour branch is up to date with 'origin/Exercise_wk4'.\n\nThen we can attempt to merge:\n\n% git merge Wk4_markup   \nAuto-merging README.md\nCONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in README.md\nCONFLICT (add/add): Merge conflict in README.Rmd\nAuto-merging README.Rmd\nAutomatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.\n\nWe’ve now effectively created a conflict. A conflict must be resolved before a merge is possible. If you switch to GiHub desktop, you’ll see this pop-up\n\nYou can use the drop-down menu to choose either modified file version as the one to keep after merging (which means you’ll throw out the other version from the other branch)\n\nThere is also the option to open the file in the editor and manually resolve the conflict.\n\nWe now see the detail about this conflict. Remember that we took an old state as our point of departure? After that point I have changed the header of the Readme.Rmd file. This conflict needs to be resolved before we can merge these branches.\n\n\n3.6.11.1 Resolve the conflict\nChoose Wk4_markup as the reference. Throw out the version from Exercise_wk4. You can do this manually or by choosing the following drop-down item in GitHub Desktop:\n\nAfter that, we can stage the changes and commit them in the Exercise_wk4 branch:\n\n% git add -A\n% git commit -m 'conflict resolved'\n\n\n\n\n\n3.6.12 Hand in your exercise\n\nTake the merged Exercise_wk4 branch as your point of departure\nCreate a new branch named Wk3_yourname\nChange the filename of the text file to yourname.txt\nStage the changes\nCommit the changes with a custom message\nPublish your branch on GitHub\nDo a pull request that can be automatically merged.\nPost an issue in your forked template (remember Section 1), wherin you properly reference your PR to the old course repo.\n\nYou should now have all the skills to fill your template with the course deliverables and exercises. Now would be a good time to update your deliverables repository. If you have any questions, please post them as an issue to the course repository.\n\n\n\n3.6.13 Solution\n\n% git branch Wk4_gerkovink \n% git checkout Wk4_gerkovink\nSwitched to branch 'Wk4_gerkovink'\n% mv add_text_file.txt gerkovink.txt\n% git add -A\n% git commit -m 'gerko`s commit'    \n[Wk4_gerkovink fb26e75] gerko`s commit\n 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)\n rename add_text_file.txt =&gt; gerkovink.txt (100%)\n% git push origin Wk4_gerkovink\nEnumerating objects: 15, done.\nCounting objects: 100% (15/15), done.\nDelta compression using up to 8 threads\nCompressing objects: 100% (10/10), done.\nWriting objects: 100% (10/10), 1002 bytes | 1002.00 KiB/s, done.\nTotal 10 (delta 7), reused 0 (delta 0)\nremote: Resolving deltas: 100% (7/7), completed with 3 local objects.\nremote: \nremote: Create a pull request for 'Wk4_gerkovink' on GitHub by visiting:\nremote:      https://github.com/gerkovink/markup2020/pull/new/Wk4_gerkovink\nremote: \nTo https://github.com/gerkovink/markup2020.git\n * [new branch]      Wk4_gerkovink -&gt; Wk4_gerkovink",

In this week’s exercises, you will make the simulation study easier to reproduce. By the end of the exercises you’ve created an improved version of how this simulation may be represented in the online supplement.\nAll the best,\nHanne and Gerko",

Pay attention to e.g.\n\n\nwho are you\nwhat do you do (e.g. expertise, service, product)\nwhere people may find you (GitHub, Company page, facebook, G+, twitter, etc.)\naccomplishments/publications/qualifications/skills etc.\ndetailed curriculum vitae\n\n\nAdd a link to your website to the README.md file of your repository.\nMake your website into a GitHub template\nHand in the link to your hosted personal repository as well as a link to your template on GitHub - it is a deliverable for this course. Also add a zip of the repo at the time of handing in - on your GitHub repo click the green Code button and choose Download ZIP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternative\n\n\n\nIf you already know how to build a webpage with any other means, you can also use that. The goal is to have a webpage as a developer portfolio that showcases you and your work. Still, you need to hand in the link to a working web-page, a template on GitHub and an archive (on GitHub click the green code button and Download ZIP) of your site at the time of handing it in.\n\n\n\n5.1.1 Custom domain\nIf you want to use a custom domain name, you need to buy one. You can do this on many websites. To use a custom domain with Github pages, you need to add a CNAME file to your repository. You can read more about this here. After addition of the CNAME, your website will be available at the custom domain. For example, where my website is available at https://gerkovink.github.io, I can also access it at https://www.gerkovink.com. Any repository converted to a GitHub pages website (such as this course webpage) will then not only be available at https://username.github.io/repositoryname, but also at and https://www.customdomain.com/repositoryname.\n\n\n5.1.2 Render on push to main\nIf you’d like your site to render when you push changes to the main branch, while your site is deployed from the gh-pages branch, you must\n\nfollow the flow outlined in the lecture\ncreate an empty gh-pages branch by running the following commands in your terminal:\n\n\n\nTerminal\n\ngit checkout --orphan gh-pages\ngit reset --hard # make sure all changes are committed before running this!\ngit commit --allow-empty -m \"Initialising gh-pages branch\"\ngit push origin gh-pages\n\nGitHub will automatically deploy webpages with an action. To also build your Quarto project, add the following action to a file in the path .github/workflows/publish.yml:\n\n\n.github/workflows/publish.yml\n\non:\n  workflow_dispatch:\n  push:\n    branches: main\n\nname: Quarto Publish\n\njobs:\n  build-deploy:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    permissions:\n      contents: write\n    steps:\n      - name: Check out repository\n        uses: actions/checkout@v4\n\n      - name: Set up Quarto\n        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/setup@v2\n        \n      - name: Render and Publish\n        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/publish@v2\n        with:\n          target: gh-pages\n        env:\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}",

    "text": "6.2 R packages\nIt is much easier to create, manage and co-develop an R package when you incorporate it into a distributed version control system like Git. The extension to a software development hosting service like GitHub is then a natural one. Although there are other procedures, devops systems and hosting services that may lend itself for package development, we outline the workflow with Git and GitHub. We also assume that you have RStudio installed.\n\n6.2.1 Recap on Git\nGit is a free and open source version control system for text files. It can handle extensive change logging for you, no matter the size of the project. Git is fast and efficient, but its effectiveness depends also on the frequency you instruct it to log your project’s changes.\nYou can see Git as a blank canvas that starts at a certain point in time. Every time you (or others) instruct Git to log any changes that have been made, Git adds the changes that are made to this canvas. We call the changes to the canvas commits. With every commit an extensive log is created that includes at least the following information:\n\nthe changes made\nwho made the changes\nmetadata\na small piece of text that describe the changes made\n\nThe difference between two commits - or the changes between them - are called diffs.\nIf you’d like to know much more about Git, this online book is a very good resource. If you’d like to practice with the command line interface use this webpage for a quick course. This book covers pretty much everything you need to marry Git and R.\n\n\n6.2.2 Why GitHub\nGitHub is the social and user interface to Git that allows you to work in repositories. These repositories can be seen as project folders in which you publish your work, but you can also use them as test sites for development, testing, etcetera. There is a distinction between private repositories (only for you and those you grant access) and public repositories (visible for everyone).\nYour public repositories can be viewed and forked by everyone. Forking is when other people create a copy of your repository on their own account. This allows them to work on a repository without affecting the master. You can also do this yourself, but then the process is called branching instead of forking. If you create a copy of a repository that is offline, the process is called cloning.\nGitHub’s ability to branch, fork and clone is very useful as it allows other people and yourself to experiment on (the code in) a repository before any definitive changes are merged with the master. If you’re working in a forked repository, you can submit a pull request to the repository collaborators to accept (or reject) any suggested changes.\nFor now, this may be confusing, but I hope you recognize the benefits GitHub can have on the process of development and bug-fixing. For example, the most up-to-date version of the mice package in R can be directly installed from the mice repository with the following code:\n\ninstall.packages(\"devtools\")\ndevtools::install_github(repo = \"stefvanbuuren/mice\")\n\nYou can see that this process requires package devtools that expands the R functionality with essential development tools. Loading packages in R directly from their respective GitHub repositories, allows you to obtain the latest - often improved and less buggy - iteration of that software even before it is published on CRAN.\n\n\n6.2.3 Install RStudio\nInstall RStudio from Posit’s website. The free edition will suffice.",

The reason for this behaviour is the IEC 60559 standard where a 5 is expected to be rounded to the even digit.\nIf we’d like to round up to the next integer, we can easily define the following function:\n\nrounder &lt;- function(x){\n  diff &lt;- x - floor(x)\n  out &lt;- x %&gt;% ceiling()\n  out[diff &lt; .5] &lt;- floor(x)[diff &lt; .5]\n  return(out)\n}\n\nwhere the vector c(0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5) is rounded up to the next integer\n\nc(0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5) %&gt;% rounder()\n\n[1] 1 2 3 4\n\n\nand where the vector c(0.49, 1.49, 2.49, 3.49) is rounded down to the previous integer\n\nc(0.49, 1.49, 2.49, 3.49) %&gt;% rounder()\n\n[1] 0 1 2 3",

    "text": "6.4 Create R-package roundR\nThe goal of this document is to create the code for the rounder() function into a stand-alone R-package with its referable Digital Object Identifier\n\n6.4.1 Steps in creating an R-package\n\n6.4.1.1 Packages and sources needed\nWe need the following packages to help us with building, testing and maintaining our package:\n\nlibrary(devtools) # development tools\nlibrary(usethis)  # automated package and project setup\nlibrary(testthat) # unit testing\n\n\n\n6.4.1.2 Preparing the package structure\nWe need a location for our R-package. The simplest approach to creating the skeleton for an R-package is to use RStudio. The following gif outlines this procedure:\n\n\n\nWe have now created the necessary structure for an R-package. We can see this structure and the generated package files in the File Pane in RStudio.\n\n\n\nThe R subfolder contains all the R-code for your package and the man folder contains all the corresponding R manuals. By default, for a new R-package generated by RStudio the file hello.R is generated.\n\n\n\nAs a matter of fact, the skeleton R-package is already a fully functional R-package. Try installing the package in the build pane.\n\n\n\n\n\n6.4.1.3 Add the description\nOpen the file DESCRIPTION from the file pane. The following window opens:\n\n\n\n\nNow, replace the contents of the DESCRIPTION file with\n\nPackage: roundR\nType: Package\nTitle: Round Numeric Values to the Nearest Integer\nVersion: 0.1.0\nAuthor: Gerko Vink and Hanne Oberman\nMaintainer: Gerko Vink &lt;G.Vink@uu.nl&gt;\nDescription: In R the default choice for rounding follows the IEC 60559 standard where a 5 is expected to be rounded to the even digit. This package offers alternative functionality to round to the closest integer. \nLicense: No LiCeNsE YeT\nEncoding: UTF-8\nLazyData: true\n\nThe DESCRIPTION file governs the information about the licence, authors, contributors, maintainers, etcetera. The argument lazyData: true indicates that data sets should be lazily loaded. This means that data will not occupy any memory unless it is needed. This is a good argument to have as default.\nWe also need to set a license. Running the following code from package usethis will write a permissive MIT license to the description file\n\nusethis::use_mit_license()\n\nDon’t forget to save the updated DESCRIPTION file and change our names to your name.\n\n\n6.4.1.4 Add the functional code\nNow it is time to extend the package with the functionality we promised in our updated DESCRIPTION. To do so, we start a new file names rounder.R by either manually creating it in the R sub folder, or by running the following code evaluation\n\nusethis::use_r(\"rounder\")\n\nThe use_r() function from the usethis package is very convenient, because it creates the necessary file in the correct location and opens the file in the editor pane.\n\n\n\n\nNow that we have created the file for our functional code, we can start building the code file. The most flexible approach to creating and maintaining a package is to use roxygen2. The roxygen2 package is a convenient in-line documentation convention that generates your Rd documentation, NAMESPACE file, and much more for you. Remember that man folder in our package root? That contains all documentation files. However, you can imagine if we have two seperate locations for our R-code and our Rd help files, that at some point the code and documentation might get out of sync. For example, if we update the code, but forget to reflect changes in our manual, the usability of our package may be at stake and documentation to end-users might get confusing. Most of all, it would be a lot of work for us to maintain multiple linked files in multiple locations. roxygen2 solves this for us by extracting the documentation from our R-code file. The only thing we need to do is maintain a single file.\nTo start with roxygen2 in our package, we need to instruct the package to use roxygen2 from now on:\n\nusethis::use_roxygen_md()\n\nThe above call will add the following lines to our DESCRIPTION file:\n\nRoxygen: list(markdown = TRUE)\nRoxygenNote: 7.3.2\n\nWe mentioned before that the roxygen2 engine expects the function documentation in the same file as the function code. A good starting point for that documentation is the following block:\n\n#' A short description of your function\n#' \n#' @param x The first argument to be governed by the letter x.\n#' @param y The second argument to denoted by the letter y.\n#' @returns a short description of the expected return.\n#' @examples\n#' examplecode 1\n#' examplecode 2\n\nIn R, when you have executed usethis::use_r() and have filled in your R code, you can run Code &gt; Insert Roxygen Skeleton to automatically create the relevant roxygen documentation. For our function rounder() - with some customization and examples, this could result in the following rounder.R code file\n\n#' Round to the nearest integer\n#'\n#'Function \\code{\\link{base::round}} rounds - by default -  the number `1.5` to\n#'integer `2` and the number `2.5` also to integer `2`. The reason for this\n#'behaviour is the IEC 60559 standard where a 5 is expected to be rounded to the\n#'even digit. This function provides an integer rounding alternative to\n#'\\code{\\link{base::round}}.\n#'\n#' @param x A numeric element or vector to round to the nearest integer\n#' @returns An integer element or vector\n#' @author Gerko Vink \\email{g.vink@uu.nl} and Hanne Oberman \\email{h.i.oberman@uu.nl}\n#' @examples\n#' # rounds weirdly\n#' c(0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5) %&gt;% round()\n#' # rounds correctly\n#' c(0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5) %&gt;% rounder()\n#'\nrounder &lt;- function(x) {\n  diff &lt;- x - floor(x)\n  out &lt;- x %&gt;% ceiling()\n  out[diff &lt; .5] &lt;- floor(x)[diff &lt; .5]\n  return(out)\n}\n\nYou can copy the above code chunk to your rounder.R file. A good source to find inspiration for writing roxygen2 documentation is the roxygen2 reference page.\nNow that we have a working rounder.R file with documentation included, we can build the documentation. A good wrapper function to build all documentation in your package is the following code evaluation:\n\ndevtools::document()\n\n\n\n\n\nThe document() function from the devtools package will build all documentation for all files that use roxygen2 and it will build the NAMESPACE of your package accordingly. If you encounter the following message:\n\nSkipping NAMESPACE\n✖ It already exists and was not generated by roxygen2. \n\njust remove the NAMESPACE file and re-run the document() function.\nWe can now remove the R/hello.R and man/hello.Rd files as they are not supposed to be part of our package\n\n\n6.4.1.5 Building and checking\nLet’s check the functionality of our package.\n\n\n\n\nWe can see under build &gt; check that our current package yields 1 error, 1 warning and 1 note.\n\n6.4.1.5.1 Error\n\n❯ checking examples ... ERROR\n  Running examples in ‘roundR-Ex.R’ failed\n  The error most likely occurred in:\n\n    ...\n  \n  &gt; c(0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5) %&gt;% round()\n  Error in c(0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5) %&gt;% round() : \n    could not find function \"%&gt;%\"\n  Execution halted\n\nThe error stems from the examples in our documentation. The examples use the binary function %&gt;% from package magrittr, but we did not load that package in the example. Remember that these examples are self-contained and that any dependent packages need to be explicitly loaded via library() for the code to run. Just like any other R instance. Simply adding library(magrittr) to the example code will solve the issue.\nAdd library(magrittr) to the example code:\n\n#' @examples\n#' library(magrittr)\n#' # rounds weirdly\n#' c(0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5) %&gt;% round()\n#' # rounds correctly\n#' c(0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5) %&gt;% rounder()\n\n\n\n6.4.1.5.2 Warning\n\n❯ checking Rd cross-references ... WARNING\n  Missing link or links in documentation object 'rounder.Rd':\n    ‘base::round’\n  \n  See section 'Cross-references' in the 'Writing R Extensions' manual.\n\nThe error stems from the crossreference we attempted in our documentation. The proper way to refer to function round() from package base is not with \\link{base::round}, but with \\link[base]{round} following the structure \\link[package]{function}. We could have opted for not referencing, or linking the round() function at all, but this would not align with open and inclusive development conventions.\nCorrect the faulty crossreferences in the documentation:\n\n#'Function \\code{\\link[base]{round}} rounds - by default -  the number `1.5` to\n#'integer `2` and the number `2.5` also to integer `2`. The reason for this\n#'behaviour is the IEC 60559 standard where a 5 is expected to be rounded to the\n#'even digit. This function provides an integer rounding alternative to\n#'\\code{\\link[base]{round}}.\n\n\n\n6.4.1.5.3 Note\n\n❯ checking R code for possible problems ... NOTE\n  rounder: no visible global function definition for ‘%&gt;%’\n  Undefined global functions or variables:\n    %&gt;%\n\nWe use function %&gt;% from package magrittr, but we neglected to make explicit that this function should have been imported from package magrittr. In other words, R needs to know that our package roundR would depend on package magrittr for its functionality to work.\nWe can fix this by runnin the following usethis evaluation in the console:\n\nusethis::use_import_from(\"magrittr\", \"%&gt;%\")\n\nWhen asked\n\n`use_import_from()` requires package-level documentation.\nWould you like to add it now?\n\n1: For sure\n2: Not now\n3: No way\n\nchoose the fun option that would add it (i.e. For Sure, Yes, Absolutely, etc). These options change every time you re-run the function code, so read it carefully!\nOnce you have selected the correct option, we can re-run the CHECK. You will find that there still persists an error in the example:\n\n❯ checking examples ... ERROR\n  Running examples in ‘roundR-Ex.R’ failed\n  The error most likely occurred in:\n  \n  ...\n  \n  &gt; c(0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5) %&gt;% rounder()\n  Error in rounder(.) : could not find function \"rounder\"\n  Calls: %&gt;%\n  Execution halted\n\nOur package CHECK cannot find function rounder(). That may seem weird, since it is the only function in our package. The thing is - we have not explicitly told roxygen2 to export our function, i.e. to make our function available outside of the package namespace. Simply adding @export to the rounder.R file would solve this error:\n\n...\n#' @author Gerko Vink \\email{g.vink@uu.nl} and Hanne Oberman \\email{h.i.oberman@uu.nl}\n#' @export\n#' @examples\n#' library(magrittr)\n...\n\nTry re-running the CHECK to see if you hit three green check marks (NO errors, warnings and notes). If all is well, you’ll see:\n\n── R CMD check results ────────────────────────────────────────── roundR 0.1.0 ────\nDuration: 6.6s\n\n0 errors ✔ | 0 warnings ✔ | 0 notes ✔\n\nR CMD check succeeded\n\n\n\n\n6.4.1.6 Increasing the version\nNow that we have a working package with a succesfull R CMD check, we might think about updating the version of the package. After all, a lot has changed since the last version got defined at the start of our development journey.\nThe easiest means to increasing the version to 0.2.0 (indicating a minor update) is to use\n\nusethis::use_version()\n\nYou will be presented with something like:\n\n✔ Setting active project to '/Users/gerko/surfdrive/Werk/GitHub/roundR/roundR'\nCurrent version is 0.1.1.\nWhat should the new version be? (0 to exit) \n\n1: major --&gt; 1.0.0\n2: minor --&gt; 0.2.0\n3: patch --&gt; 0.1.2\n4:   dev --&gt; 0.1.1.9000\n\nSelection: 2\n✔ Setting Version field in DESCRIPTION to '0.2.0'\nThere is 1 uncommitted file:\n* 'DESCRIPTION'\nIs it ok to commit it?\n\n1: For sure\n2: Negative\n3: Nope\n\nSelection: 1\n✔ Adding files\n✔ Making a commit with message 'Increment version number to 0.2.0'\n\nThe question Is it ok to commit it? is related to Git. Please click to commit the version increase. For reasons of brevity and simplicity, we will leave a thorough discussion of incremental Git commits for now and demonstrate to use of Git and GitHub at the end of this walkthrough.\n\n\n6.4.1.7 Add tests\nThe next step for a mature package is to include tests. Every function should have functional tests. The testthat package is geared to that. Make sure that you have the rounder.R file open in the Source pane and run:\n\nusethis::use_test()\n\nThe proper structure for test files has now been created:\n\n✔ Adding 'testthat' to Suggests field in DESCRIPTION\n✔ Setting Config/testthat/edition field in DESCRIPTION to '3'\n✔ Creating 'tests/testthat/'\n✔ Writing 'tests/testthat.R'\n✔ Writing 'tests/testthat/test-rounder.R'\n• Modify 'tests/testthat/test-rounder.R'\n\nYou are asked to modify the tests/testthat/test-rounder.R file. Replace the example test with:\n\ntest_that(\"rounder works\", {\n  A &lt;- c(0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5) %&gt;% rounder()\n  B &lt;- c(0.49, 1.49, 2.49, 3.49) %&gt;% rounder()\n  expect_equal(A, c(1, 2, 3, 4))\n  expect_equal(B, c(0, 1, 2, 3))\n})\n\ntest_that(\"rounder yields different results than round\", {\n  vec1 &lt;- c(0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5)\n  vec2 &lt;- c(0.499999999999999999995,\n            1.499999999999999999995,\n            2.499999999999999999995,\n            3.499999999999999999995)\n  A &lt;- vec1 %&gt;% rounder()\n  B &lt;- vec1 %&gt;% round()\n  C &lt;- vec2 %&gt;% rounder()\n  D &lt;- vec2 %&gt;% round()\n  expect_false(identical(A, B))\n  expect_false(identical(C, D))\n})\n\nClick the Test button in the build pane:\n\n\n\nAll test should pass, meaning that your rounder() function yields correct results (test 1) that differ fundamentally from the results obtained with round() (test 2).\nIf test would fail, you’d be notified. For example\n\ntest_that(\"rounder works\", {\n  A &lt;- c(0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5) %&gt;% rounder()\n  expect_equal(A, c(4, 3, 2, 1))\n  })\n\n── Failure: rounder works ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n`A` not equal to c(4, 3, 2, 1).\n4/4 mismatches (average diff: 2)\n[1] 1 - 4 == -3\n[2] 2 - 3 == -1\n[3] 3 - 2 ==  1\n[4] 4 - 1 ==  3\n\n\nError:\n! Test failed\n\n\nFortunately, our test all passed. Now rerun the R CMD check. If all is well you’ll receive confirmation of a successful check.\n\n\n6.4.1.8 Publishing to GitHub\nThis section assumes that you are logged into your GitHub account. If you have trouble realizing this, GitHub has a great step-by-step walkthrough.\nLet’s publish our R-package to GitHub. To do so, we need to perform two steps. First, we must log (commit) our changes to the Git distributed version control system. This stores the file changes to our own machine. Next we must link our local Git to a remote online repository on GitHub. Luckily, with GitHub Desktop, we can perform all these steps in a single window interface.\nLet’s start by adding our R-package to GitHub desktop. Remember that we already started the package in RStudio as a Git repository, so we only have to point GitHub desktop to the correct directory.\n\n\n\nNext, we commit the changes. This means that we save the state of files for a moment in time, so that we can always revert to that state and see how the files changed with respect to the previous state.\n\n\n\nNaturally, you would not only do this at the start (when RStudio created the Git repository) and end (when we have a working package), but at regular and informative intervals. For example, when you add a function, a test, a help file, a license, etcetera.\nNow that we have commited our package, we can publish it on GitHub.\n\n\n\nTry your online GitHub repositories at https://github.com. You will see your package there and that the license is automatically recognized. You will also see that you are in the main branch. By default, that will be the live version of your package. Now that your package is live, it would be nice to add a Readme file that informs visitors to your repository. But we will extend our workflow with a good behaviour: not working in the main branch. We would not want to accidentally overwrite or break the functionality of our package, just because we were working in the same branch. So let’s add a Readme to a new development branch.\n\n\n\nWhen we commit the new Readme file to the development branch, a new window opens to propose the pull request (PR). The PR is nothing more than a request to the package developers to pull your proposed changes into (usually) the main branch of the software. Since we are the developers, we have to both create and accept the PR.\n\n\n\nIt is good procedure to write an informative PR message, usually outlining the nature and rationale of the changes. I also demonstrate how to accept a PR, thereby approving the changes per file (only one now) and signing it with my initials. I cannot formally approve my own PR, since that would leave great opportunity for subjectivity or error. Proper procedure would be to have someone else check and approve your changes.\n\n\n\nWhen you go back to GitHub desktop and fetch the changes on teh remote (that would be GitHub online), you will see that you have now access to the readme file and the development branch.\n\n\n6.4.1.9 Registering a DOI\nNow that we have a proper and open source package online and the world as our user base, it would be wise to allow for proper referencing of our package.\nGitHub and Zenodo have paired to facilitate this procedure. If you link your Zenodo account to GitHub, as outlined here, you only have to click, copy and paste to fully make your GitHub repo citeable.\n\n\n\n\n\n6.4.1.10 Add citation\nZenodo prepares the repository citation for us. We can simply grab the info, change our personal information and submit it to GitHub.\n\n\n\nThe final step before we would put our package out there is to notify how users can refer to our package. Run the following code:\n\nusethis::use_citation()\n\nwhich will create the necessary citation files for modification\n\n✔ Creating 'inst/'\n✔ Writing 'inst/CITATION'\n• Modify 'inst/CITATION'\n\nWe can now simply grab the text and/or bibtex citation from GitHub and paste it into the CITATION file. The citation info cf. R-packages could be:\n\ncitHeader(\"To cite roundR in publications use:\")\n\ncitEntry(\n  entry    = \"Manual\",\n  title    = \"gerkovink/roundR: Version 0.2.0 - First release\",\n  author   = \"Gerko Vink and Hanne Oberman\",\n  year     = \"2023\",\n  doi      = \"10.5281/zenodo.7668889\",\n  url      = \"github.com/gerkovink/roundR\",\n  textVersion = paste(\n\"Vink, G and Oberman, H.I.
